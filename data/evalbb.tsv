<s><s><s> I know, I'm not ready for a pet either. I've been thinking about it for a while now.</s>
<s> Not yet, but I'm sure it will be soon.  It's been a long time since we've had a new TV.</s>
<s> No, I have not. I don't know what I'm going to do without it.</s>
<s> I don't know. I think I'm going to stay home and read a good book.</s>
<s><s><s> I love the theater!  I love musicals.  What is it about?</s>

<s> I did, but it was a long time ago and I don't know if I'll ever get over it.</s>
<s> That's what I'm hoping for, but I don't want to be late for work.</s>
<s><s><s> I hope so.  I don't want to get in trouble for something I didn't do.</s>
<s> I know, right? It's so gross. I don't know what I'm going to do.</s>
<s> Do you have any pets? I have a dog and a cat. I love them.</s>
<s> I think that's a good idea. I would do the same if I were in your shoes.</s>
<s> That's so cool!  Did you have a good time?  What did you guys do?</s>
<s> I am sorry to hear that.  I am divorced.  My marriage was terminated due to sexual incompatibility.</s>

<s><s><s> I was in a hurry and forgot to put on my seat belt. I was so ashamed of myself.</s>
<s> I've thought about it, but I don't know if it's the right time yet.</s>
<s> Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries it requires the sanction of a court or other authority.</s>
<s> I think it depends on the person. Some people think it's better to stay together than divorce, but that's not always the case.</s>
<s> I don't know. I guess I just want to be a part of something that makes me happy.</s>
<s> No, I am not, but I hope you have a great time! What instrument do you play?</s>
<s> No, I don't know how to play it. I think I'll just buy a new one.</s>

<s> I went to bed at 9. I was up late because I had to get up early for work.</s>
<s> I went to the store and bought some groceries. I felt so bad about it.</s>

<s> I'm not sure what you mean by that, can you elaborate a little bit more?</s>
<s> I would love to, but I don't have anyone to go with. Do you have any suggestions?</s>
<s> No, not at all.  It's been a long time since I've been there.</s>
<s> I'm not sure, but I do know that there are a lot of good shows on HBO.</s>

<s><s> That's a good idea.  It's always good to be prepared.  What kind of work do you do?</s>
<s> It's okay, it happens to the best of us. I hope you had a good rest of your day.</s>
<s> I think I'm going to take a nap. I've been up all night studying.</s>
<s> I don't think so, but thank you for the offer. I appreciate it a lot.</s>

<s> I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'm sure you can figure it out.</s>
<s><s> That's what I was thinking too, but it seems like a good deal to me.</s>
<s> No, I am a housewife, but my husband is a stay-at-home dad.</s>
<s> Wow, that's a lot of rooms. Do you have any pets or kids?</s>
<s> That's a good idea, but I don't think I would be able to do that.</s>
<s> Hi, I'm Terry. Nice to meet you. Do you have any pets?</s>
<s> Yes, I have a pair of Nike Air Jordans. They are my favorite shoes.</s>
<s> Size 5 is the perfect size for me.  I am 6 feet tall.  How about you?</s>
<s> I love the color black. It is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting.</s>
<s> Oh, that's a bummer. Why did she buy them if you don't mind me asking?</s>
<s> Oh, I see.  I thought they were in the UK.  How long ago did she buy them?</s>

<s> I don't have a car, so I can't answer that. But I do know that it's important to have a reliable vehicle.</s>

<s><s> I'm not sure, but I'm sure it's something that can't be overlooked.</s>
<s> Yes, it does.  I was shocked when I saw it on the market.  It was a good deal.</s>
<s><s><s> I think it is a good choice.  It will last you a long time.</s>
<s> No, I have never audited for anything. I am not very good at speaking in front of people.</s>

<s> It says that I am going to get a promotion at work.  I am so excited!</s>
<s> Yes, it is.  I am so excited.  It is going to be so much fun.</s>

<s> I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are doing okay. Are you okay?</s>

<s> I can speak pretty well, but I don't think I'm very good at it. </s>
<s> I don't speak spanish, but I do know that it is the second most spoken language in the world.</s>
<s> That's true, but it would be nice to be able to speak another language fluently.</s>
<s> I'm not sure, but I'm sure I'll find out when I get home from work.</s>
<s> Oh no! I hope you can find a way to get to the museum soon!</s>

<s> I think they do, but I don't know if they really love me or just want me to be happy.</s>
<s> Yes, I am the oldest of my siblings and my parents are the youngest.</s>
<s> Oh, I see.  That's a good point.  I guess it's hard to be a parent when you don't know how to properly raise a child.</s>
<s> I have tried, but they don't seem to understand what I'm trying to tell them.</s>
<s> It was great! I got to see all the sights of the world. How about you?</s>
<s> I was walking home from work.  I was so happy to see it.  It was so beautiful.</s>
