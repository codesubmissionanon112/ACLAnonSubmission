  Hello, how are you doing today? 
  Have you had any type of cold lately? 
  Do you have any allergies that you know of? 
  Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active? 
  I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma. 
  Hey Jimmy. Let's go workout later today. 
  How about at 3:30? 
  Hey. I just played basketball earlier, so my legs are a little sore. Let's work out on arms and stomach today. 
  C'mon. We're only switching two days. You can do legs on Friday. 
  Did you go to school today? 
  I didn't want to, so I didn't. 
  That's a switch. 
  No, I haven't. Why? 
  So go then. 
  Well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow? 
  Honey, I think you should quit smoking. 
  But I want you to be fit. 
  Check out this article. It says smoking can lead to lung cancer. 
  But you know that smoking does harm to health, right? 
  Stop beating around the bush. Will you quit or not? 
  Excuse me, Mr. White? I just need you to sign these before I leave. 
  That's my job, sir. Just one more signature here, please. 
  Hey, Karen. Look like you got some sun this weekend. 
  That's great. Where did you stay? 
  So, what did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, obviously. 
  Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming? 
  It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that. 
  How do you usually spend your leisure time? I mean, do you have any special interests out of your job? 
  Yeah, you're quite right and what's your hobby? 
  Oh, photography, It's really a good hobby. 
  You yourself have a photo studio? 
  I am tired of everything in my life. 
  You don't know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years. I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings. 
  There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong. The city is so bright at night, with all the neon signs. 
  I think that there are too many of them. I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising. They should have lower prices instead. Then they would see more. 
  I really hate receiving spam. I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway. 
  I like that too. I don't like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don't buy a certain product, you're not cool or modern or efficient or something. 
  What sports do you think women excel at most? 
  I mean which ones are they better at than men? 
  That's a good point. Let me change my question. What sports do women like best? 
  Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized? 
  Is there a city where it's always warm? 
  Are there any other cities where it's always hot? 
  But why do so many people live there? 
  Are there any cities where it rains a lot? 
  Tell us about some cold cities. 
  Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston? 
  Julia, I would like to have a word with you. Have a seat. 
  According to your performance, I decided to give you a salary increase. From next month, there will be a 2, 000 yuan raise to your salary. Although your first raise might not sound considerable, the company believes that with your ability, sooner or later you'll get a better raise. 
  I think you deserved this. 
  Hello, Sara are you finished packing yet? Do you need a hand? 
  Make sure you have your ID card. You will need it while you travel. 
  All your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer. 
  Sara? 
  Did you buy a map? Traveling can be really inconvenient without one, and you could even wind up lost 
  Also, take these pills in case you have any airsickness, and take some cold medicine, too. How about some band-aids? 
  Take care, dear! Be careful! Oh Sara, wait a minute! You forget your raincoat and umbrella. 
  Can I help you, ma'am. 
  Are you all our guests? 
  Please fill in this form. 
  So you are leaving this evening. We keep your bags until 6 p. m. Here's your tag. 
  sorry, Brad. But you are going to have to re-do this. 
  It's badly organized. I can't present this to the board. 
  Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better? 
  Well, usually people think I'm a terrible singer, but after we all have a few beers, they say I sound a lot better! 
  Then after a few beers, you'll be singing in Taiwanese? 
  Good afternoon, Miss Qi. 
  How are you feeling today? 
  That's good. Well, these are for you. I hope you will like them. 
  I've also brought some magazines for you. I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital. 
  It's time for me to leave. I hope you will recover soon. See you later. 
  Amy, you don't look so well. What happened? 
  Do you feel anything else? 
  Have you had similar feelings before? 
  Don't worry. I believe you are just not agreeing with the local climate. I will get you some medicine. You will be alright after a good rest. 
  I've been working hard for a whole year. I really need a break. 
  You said it. I'm looking forward to my annual vacation. 
  Later this month. I can't wait! 
  Do you know anything about health food? 
  Can you give me some examples? 
  Really? Why we must have warm and fresh water? 
  Anything else? 
  The bridegroom looks a bit nervous. 
  Oh, they are playing the wedding March. Here they come. 
  I am so happy for them. 
  Yes, I always cry at weddings. 
  Yes, they are. 
  In fact, we are beginning to make preparations. 
  No, no, for the engagement. 
  We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning. What do you say we take a break and listen to some music, okay? 
  While you're picking out a record to play, I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator. 
  Yeah, I've got everything from rock n'roll to the latest new - wave stuff. 
  Sorry, my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960's. Music written before then is just history to me. 
  Excuse me. Does this bus go to the National Library of China? 
  How long is the ride? 
  Thank you. Would you please let me know when we get to the stop? I'm a stranger here. 
  How are you, Mrs. Brandon? 
  Not so good. I lost my job today. 
  How are your students doing? 
  I remember you gave our class a hard final test in my first year of college. Many of us failed. But I really learned a lot from you. You see, I can speak very good English. 
  Anne, thanks so much for introducing me to Caroline! Our first date went so well. I'm so excited to be in love right now. 
  I want to climb the highest mountain and shout, Caroline, will you marry me?! 
  Can I help you? 
  Would you be interested in a three-bedroom flat? I have a few now. 
  Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the Rainbow Restaurant from here? 
  Adam, could you show me around the school?  
  What's the tallest building?  
  Yes.  
  What's the building to the south of the library?  
  Is there a swimming pool in your school?  
  I do envy you. And I hope I can enter your school one day.  
  I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen.  
  I've already got a small pan. I need a big one.  
  Oh, no, that's way too heavy a pan for me.  
  Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle.  
  Oh, this feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it.  
  Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan.  
  Come in, come in!  
  I thought we were supposed to meet here.  
  I'm sorry. We must have misunderstood each other.  
  You're right. I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie.  
  Good morning, I'm Daniel. I'm applying for the positon of manager.  
  I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX, LIPTON and WALLS. After making a customer survey, I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese.  
  It's the job I'm interested in. And your company is the best-known. Although I don't have much experience as a manager, the job description you sent to me was very interesting. It's a job I've been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it.  
  I don't think so. As the saying goes, A great oak needs deep roots. I'm really interested in this job.  
  What's wrong with you, Lucy? 
  Have you called the local dog shelters? 
  We can always look for miracles. Does he have any identification on him? 
  I understand. I used to pet dogs, too. Let's walk around the neighborhood. Hey, look! There he is. 
  Hong, it seems like you really struggle to learn English, is this level too hard for you? 
  Hmm, I have an idea that you'll like. This week, you can do a special project for class. 
  I want you to watch some YouTube videos of people speaking in different English accents. I'll send you the links for the ones you should watch, they're very funny. One person does about 30 different accents in 10 minutes. 
  It shouldn't, this is just a fun project to help you get more interested in the lessons. There is a more serious side to it, though. I want you to write a one page essay about the videos and tell the class about your project on Friday. You can show some of the videos during your presentation too if you like. I think the whole class will benefit from this. 
  Mr. Brown, are your children always kicking up a row like this? I cannot concentrate on my paper. 
  I'm afraid if the noise goes on, I shall have no alternative but to leave. 
  I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit. 
  If I were Li Na, I would ask her if she had done that. 
  How do you like these dishes? 
  Did you enjoy your dinner? 
  Would you like some more rice? 
  Another piece of meat pie? 
  How about the dessert? 
  This place serves good breakfasts, don't you think? 
  What are you planning to do today? 
  Have you done windsurfing before? 
  Can you take a little advice from a friend? 
  Don't waste your money. Windsurfing is very hard. And it will be windy today. They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour, and you won't be able to windsurf. You will fall and fall and fall. 
  Yes, but it takes a long time to learn. You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer. 
  The stepmother was very wicked. She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face. 
  And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy. 
  Well, no one could survive without water, but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking. 
  But what are the sources of water pollution? 
  Well, direct ones are the pollution directly from factories, refineries waste treatment plants etc. , aren't they? 
  But what about the indirect ones? 
  I see. For the sake of us all, we should be an active participator in the prevention of it. 
  I'm not sure, is this our stop? 
  Do you have any idea where we are? 
  This can't be the right stop. 
  We got off too early, didn't we? 
  I should've just stayed on the bus. 
  Great, we have to walk now. 
  To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 101 to New York City? 
  Show me the fastest way to get there. 
  Do you think the plane will leave without me? 
  Thank you so much. I would really appreciate that. 
  Uh. . . that's Greek to me. 
  Well, mine are baggy. They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in. 
  So maybe we should go out after all. 
  Wangfujing Grand Hotels. How can I help you? 
  Could you hold the line, please? I will check out our room availability for those days. . . Yes. we have a few vacancies next weekend. We have double rooms, suites and deluxe suites in Japanese, Roman. French and presidential styles, which one do you like best? 
  OK. Could I have your name, please? 
  OK, Ms. Monica. I've reserved a double room for you next Saturday and Sunday night. We will see you then! 
  We can offer you a 5 % discount. 
  Well, what do you suggest then? How about 8 %? 
  What? You want to drive me bankrupt! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction. 
  How about lo %? This price is already a little tight, our profit margin is not that large. 
  OK, Mr. Wang. Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off. Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people. 
  That's true. And this trip has been a very productive one for us. 
  Believe me, Mr. Wang. I'll do my best to promote the transaction. 
  It's very kind of you to say so. 
  I think we will have opportunities to meet each other in the future. 
  Fine. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. 
  Hello. 
  Yes, please. I'd like to open a savings account. Would you please give me some advice? 
  What's the difference between the two? 
  Then how about the current account? 
  Thank you for your help. I think I'll open a current account. 
  Yes. 
  Thank you very much. 
  Hi Kevin! 
  Not much. I can assure you. And you? 
  Come on. This suspense is killing me. 
  Well, that's not exactly true. I was thinking about changing jobs. Luckily, they offered me a new position in the accounting department. 
  I wouldn't exaggerate, but I am pleased. I had been hoping to get a promotion for a while. So when it finally came through, I was relieved. Actually, that's why I was looking for a new job. I just didn't want to work there anymore if they weren't going to recognize my efforts. 
  I got a reasonable raise, now enough about me. I'm dying to hear your news. 
  No, you said you'd never get married. 
  This is all news to me. I didn't even know you were dating. 
  And you getting married? 
  Well, congratulations! That's fantastic! 
  Where were you yesterday? 
  Asleep! I thought that you had to take an exam. 
  You still look a little sick. You couldn't go back to bed. 
  What did he tell you? 
  Well, that's all right then. Are you going straight home? 
  Do you think that you should walk that far? 
  Well, take care of yourself. 
  What a great day! Hey, Tom, do you want to go to the beach this weekend? 
  I doubt it. 
  But yesterday afternoon she told me that she would go home this Saturday. 
  She said that her mother was ill and stayed in the hospital, and therefore she wanted to go home to see her. 
  That sounds great. Maybe we could have a picnic on the beach. Then let's take some sandwiches, chips, and uh... some salad as well. 
  Good. In addition, we had better pack beach towels and sun cream. 
  I'd like to find a job. 
  Yes, thank you. I'd like to apply for the job at the computer center. 
  What did the boss say to you?  
  Yeah. You look so unhappy recently. What's the matter.  
  hey Jayden, I was wondering if you could do me a favor.  
  it's kind of a big favor. I'm absolutely flat broke, and I owe my landlady $200. she's given me until Friday to give it to her, but I don't get paid until next Monday. Do you think you could loanm  
  if you can't give me the full amount, a fraction of it would still help. I'll pay you back on Monday. I promise.  
  thanks a lot Jayden. Every little bit will help. Tell you what, if you aren't doing anything tonight, why don't you come over and have dinner at my place.  
  how about at 6 pm?  
  I don't think the teacher had a right to say that. The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class.  
  I agree she had the right to say something, but I feel she should have done it privately.  
  Anna just email to say that the managers meeting is put off till next Monday. Will you have everything ready by then, Sabrina? Hey Sabrina, what's wrong? 
  How often do you call each other? 
  The Mail can be really slow sometimes. I'm sure you'll hear from her soon. 
  You know the saying 'no news is good news'. If something were wrong, someone would have called you. 
  How was your summer trip? 
  Sounds hot! How did you get along without studying the local language? 
  How did the baker react? 
  So, now ,have you been asked for an interview, yet? 
  Oh, that's the day after tomorrow, congratulations. Where will the interview be held? 
  So Izek, is there a Christian church nearby? 
  No. It's just I'm doing this essay about the influence of Christian religion on western cultures. So I just want to do some research personally. 
  Really? That would be great. Thank you so much. 
  That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful. Would you show it to me, please? 
  Could I try it on? 
  It feels a little tight around the waist. Do you have a bigger one? 
  OK. How much does it cost? 
  we really were lucky. We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation! Did you see the long lines behind us? 
  let's take a look at the menu so we can order. Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share? 
  I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa. 
  sounds good. What are you going to have for your main course? 
  what's in a dahl? 
  that sounds nice. Do you want to share some kebabs as well? 
  that's my favourite. Do you want to have some wine or beer? 
  ok, shall I flag down the waitress? 
  you're right. That might seem a bit rude. It's a good thing I've got you with me! 
  You went out on a date last night, didn't you? 
  How come? 
  Why don't you phone her for a date again? 
  Don't jump to conclusions. Look at the bright side, try to make another date again. 
  Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar? 
  We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street. 
  I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm. 
  Certainly. But if there are going to be four of us, I had better make reservations. 
  Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four. 
  Not that I know of. Why do you ask? 
  I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced. You should be fine. 
  No, its very casual there. Leave your jacket and tie at home. 
  I'll see you there at 9pm. 
  ABC Rent-a-Car. May I help you? 
  We have Volkswagen, Pinto, Plymouth and Datsun. 
  Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen, Pinto and Datsun, and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth. 
  There is no charge for mileage. And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included. 
  All right, sir. May I have your driver's license? 
  When in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say. 
  Roman is living in Rome, of course. And go to work by car, or bus, or on foot. 
  Certainly. 
  Not always. But they like good meal. 
  How can I go there to have a taste? 
  Hey Mike. I forgot about registration. I'm a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. What do you think I should do? 
  Do you think going to the registration building will help at all? 
  Did you register yet? 
  What classes do you think are still open? 
  That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester. 
  He does that? 
  That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help. 
  Hi Mary, how's it going? 
  terrible. It must be something serious. You two are such close friends. 
  really? What happened? 
  that's pretty harsh. 
  you know she probably feels just as bad. 
  well, in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want. 
  I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen. 
  I've already got a small pan. I need a big one. 
  Oh, no, that's way too heavy a pan for me. 
  Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle. 
  Oh, this feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it. 
  Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan. 
  ABC Company, my name is Lucy. How can I help you? 
  Thank you for your interest. The position is still available. Have you already sent your CV to us? 
  It is quite urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon. If all these is not problem for you, I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly. 
  This is 911. 
  Slow down and tell me your address. 
  An ambulance is on its way right now. They should be there any minute. Are you close to him right now? 
  Is he breathing? 
  Can you believe that Obama is our new President? 
  Did you vote for him? 
  I voted for him. 
  Is that right? 
  I hope so, because America needs a change. 
  I agree with you completely. 
  How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits? 
  I got laid off. 
  Do all jobs provide unemployment? 
  Do you think that my job pays unemployment? 
  Will I be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment? 
  Thank you for your interest in this job. You'll be hearing from us. Send the next applicant in on your way out, please. 
  It has been pleasant talking with you. 
  May I call you at your home about our final decision? 
  We'll get in touch with you by next Wednesday. Thank you for your interest in this job. 
  Good afternoon. 
  I've got this important letter to send to Hainan. Can I send it by registered mail? 
  How much will I have to pay? 
  Here are the letter and the money. 
  Is it overweight? 
  All right. Here is the money. 
  What shall I do with the receipt? 
  Thank you. 
  Now we have settled the terms of payment. Is it possible to effect shipment during September? 
  Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment? 
  That's too late. You see, November is the season for this commodity in our market, and our Customs formalities are rather complicated. 
  Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks. Thus, after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers. The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season. 
  Mr. Brown, you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us. If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices, we shall lose out. 
  That's too bad, but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration. 
  But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery? Make a special effort, please. A timely delivery means a lot to us. 
  I have a good feeling about this house. 
  I love the paint job! 
  What a beautiful home! 
  I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street. 
  I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen. 
  I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering! 
  What is your favorite kind of music? 
  What genres? 
  What interests you in that type of music? 
  That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music. 
  My hand still hurts from the fall on the ice yesterday. I wonder if I broke something. 
  Maria, I know you've arrived here only recently. Can you tell me if there is anything that has surprised you about British people? 
  Good morning, Lucy. Can I help you? 
  Certainly, come in and have a seat. 
  Yes, let me see now. You are studying mathematics, aren't you?. 
  I see. Have you asked your parents for their advice about this? 
  Well, your record here has been very good. I don't think you will have much trouble. 
  No trouble at all. I'd be glad to do it. Is there anything else? 
  All right, Lucy. Good luck to you. 
  I'm sure it will be wet when we arrive.  
  It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed.  
  But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money.  
  Do you think we'll need our overcoats?  
  Why not?  
  Is that very likely in England?  
  Let's call it a day.  
  It's hard to commute a long way.  
  That concludes the Consumer Report for tonight. Let's go over now to Jerry Ryan and find out what's happening in the world of sports. Jerry? 
  Hello, I work for Sunny Tour Holidays. And I'm interviewing people about their Holidays. Would you mind answering a few questions for our survey? 
  Thanks a lot. First, could you tell me about travel arrangements for your last holidays? Did you experience any difficulties in your journey? 
  And how was the hotel? 
  And how important are holidays to you? 
  Hi, Bill. Can you tell me how it happened? 
  So what happened? I guess somebody found you, right? 
  Right, so you lost your legs, but you want to try your best to stay active. 
  And you built the new legs. Can you go mountain climbing again? 
  May I come in, Mr. Sun? 
  Can I try later then? 
  Is it all right for me to come in now, Mr. Sun? 
  Do you mind if I sit down? 
  I want to leave the department. Do you think I could put info a transfer? 
  Do you mind if I speak frankly? 
  Well. You see, I don ' t like the office. I don ' t like the staff. And I ' m afraid of you. And I don ' t want to go one. So may I put info a transfer? 
  Hello, I'd like to reserve a hotel room. 
  My name is John Sandals. 
  I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 17. 
  How much per night are we talking about? 
  That price is perfectly acceptable. 
  Nonsmoking, please. 
  That sounds fine. 
  Certainly. My phone number is 626-555-1739. 
  I think I may rent this apartment from you. 
  How much are you looking to rent it for? 
  That is too expensive. 
  How does $ 850 a month sound to you? 
  That's the best that I can do. 
  Would you please reconsider? 
  I want to get on the bus already. 
  It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago. 
  I need to get to work, so it better. 
  I agree, it's just never on time. 
  I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather. 
  We need to get a car. 
  You have been here for how long? Four months now? 
  Do you know Chinese better now? 
  Oh, yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere. 
  A shouting match? You're so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don't believe it. 
  Yes, perhaps. Chinese usually don't notice that sort of thing. Maybe it's quite natural to us. 
  Hmm, what should I wear today? 
  Well, haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe? 
  Loving to look beautiful is women's nature. In fact, I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today. 
  Well, I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi. They are too small. I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size. 
  Good morning. Phyllis Seymour speaking. 
  Thank you very much, Mr. Parker. But, that is my job. 
  Where can I buy textbooks? 
  Yes, I have that. 
  No, I don't know where the bookstore is. 
  Really? How can I do that? 
  No, I can't make it today. 
  No, thanks. I'm good. 
  I'm going to try sky diving this weekend. 
  It's sounds like fun. 
  I want to try something exciting. 
  I'll tell you all about it next Monday. 
  I came to this lab to have my blood drawn. 
  What am I being tested for? 
  What does my white blood cell count tell him? 
  How much will it hurt? 
  Is that my blood going into that tube? 
  Do you have this design with only one breast pocket? 
  It's a pity. I'm afraid that's too loud for me. Thank you. 
  Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas. 
  I don't know yet. 
  I know what you mean. 
  Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them. 
  What's up, how are you? 
  Could be better. 
  I got on about fifteen minutes ago. 
  I usually just drive. 
  Yes, I have my own car. 
  I'm waiting for our President to lower the gas prices. 
  Liz, do you have a minute? 
  I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning. 
  Well, it isn't at this office. It's over at the Dayton Street office. Have you been there before? 
  Good. So you will have no trouble finding it. 
  I will talk about developing sales through our website. All the branch heads will be there, and most of the staff. 
  Well, I need the display monitor. But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday. I will need you to help with everything else. 
  Welcome back, Sir. I trust the materials were helpful to you? 
  Your credit is fine, Sir. Now, tell me, what is it that you need the loan for? 
  I see. And what loan amount are you expecting? 
  I'm sorry, Sir. The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20, 000 RMB, with no exceptions. 
  I need some documentation from you. Such as your resident permit, your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here. 
  What made you decide on this type of occupation? 
  Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty? 
  Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess? 
  Are you in good health? 
  Have you had any nursing experience? 
  How tall are you? What about your eyesight? 
  What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses? 
  If a passenger can't understand what you say, what should you do? 
  What kind of personality do you think you have? 
  Do you think you are introverted or extroverted? 
  What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy? 
  Do you have any friend you would call really close ones? 
  What kind of people would you like to work with? 
  What kind of people you find hard to work with? 
  Help me decide on which type of hotel room to book. 
  Very funny. We have a choice of different views, and each one is a different price. For instance, a room with a city view is 175 a night. 
  If you think that's too steep, there are a few other options. We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 a night or a room with an obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 a night. 
  Okay, I can request a room on an upper floor. You really don't have a preference? 
  There is a penthouse room for 400 a night. 
  Holiday Travel! What can I do for you? 
  OK. Let me see what's available. And when will you be returning? 
  OK, let me see. Hmm... the ticket price is much lower if you leave one day earlier. 
  It's only 980 dollars. 
  OK. That's flight BA 7101, from Salt Lake City to New York Kennedy Airport. Then Flight BA 2701 from Kennedy Airport to Berlin. The first flight leaves Salt Lake City at 10:00 am, and arrives in New York at 4:15 pm. Then the 2nd flight leaves Kennedy Airport at 5:45 pm. You'll arrive in Berlin at 8:30 am the next day. 
  How much freedom do your parents give you? 
  What about money? Do you have any pocket money? 
  Is there anything you'd like to do which your parents won't let you? 
  Do you think that's unfair? 
  Hi young lady. How may I help you? 
  Okay. How about getting your father a new wallet? 
  Huh ... which one? 
  Oh. It's only $40.95. 
  Hmm. How about this brown leather one? 
  It's $25.99. 
  Okay. How much money do you have to spend? 
  Hmm. How about this tie? 
  Well, let's just say the tie went on sale. How about $5.00. What do you say? 
  Shall we share a taxi?  
  I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road. It is very close to your house.  
  That's the one.  
  Yeah. If we share the cab, it'll be cheaper. Besides that your Chinese is better than mine. The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully.  
  I would like to have a custom-made skirt.  
  OK. I want it a bit close around the waist.  
  How long will it take?  
  What's the charge for the tailoring?  
  Isabelle, you know I'm not interested in fame.  
  You know I'm interested in teaching. I'm looking for jazz students. . .  
  I know they're out there. I'll find them.  
  Are you studying here?  
  What are you major in?  
  What do you think of the literature course.  
  I came to this lab to have my blood drawn.  
  What am I being tested for?  
  What does my white blood cell count tell him?  
  How much will it hurt?  
  Is that my blood going into that tube?  
  Now, Mark, you're from Canada? 
  Where is it actually that you grew up? 
  Ok, so what was your childhood like? Were you into nature or sports? 
  Ok, so when was your first trip abroad? Where did you go? 
  You look upset. Are you OK, Tommy? 
  Yes, is something wrong with it? No, don't tell me you dropped and broke it. 
  You mean someone stole my phone? 
  So you didn't see who it was? 
  You've reported it then? 
  Turn to a policeman nearby right now. I'll have a look at the insurance and see if it's covered. 
  Hi, Sam. I want to buy a pet. Do you have any ideas? 
  why? anything special there? 
  Oh, really? are there any snakes? 
  that's terrific. I can't wait to check it out. 
  why not? it's so cool. 
  pardon? 
  well, I didn't realize that. 
  oh, I should have thought of my brother's baby girl. Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet. 
  How many years have you done business with China? 
  Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete? 
  Well, it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma. Does it influence your business in China? 
  Thank you. 
  Kate, can we change the channel? 
  This channel has so many advertisements, and it doesn't have any good TV programs. 
  What about this one? Do you like this program? 
  Yes. Oh, it's a talk show. 
  No, I haven't. This is my first time to watch it. 
  Could I have my bill, please? 
  I'm afraid there's been a mistake. 
  I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing. Look, the figure of 6. 5 dollar appears here, then again here. 
  I need help with the office party. 
  I have no idea what the entertainment should be. 
  Let's make it a formal affair. 
  American food would be the best choice. 
  We should bring in a really good DJ. 
  I am here to get my prescription filled. 
  Do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail? 
  How should I take this medication? 
  Should I avoid alcohol with this medication? 
  Should I expect any side effects? 
  Mom, can I watch TV? 
  Alright, Mom. Should I turn off the TV right now? 
  Mom, where is the remote? I can't find it. 
  Is there a problem, officer? 
  Did I really? 
  I had no idea that I ran it. 
  Yes, madam. 
  I really have no excuse, madam. 
  I understand, and I am very sorry. 
  Has Alan shown up yet? 
  I wonder what happened. 
  Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital. 
  His sister had a car accident last week. 
  She is still in a coma. 
  could we possibly discuss my salary some time? 
  first of all, I want you to know that I really like working for this company. Do you think I'm doing a good job here? 
  I try very hard. The problem is, my salary just isn't enough to live on. Now that I have a wife and a child to support, we hardly have enough money for food and rent. 
  I could really use a 5 % rise. 
  listen, if you give me a raise, I'll take on extra responsibilities. 
  that's fine. Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work? 
  that sounds good to me. I really appreciate it. 
  Did you enjoy that new movie? 
  Oh, what happened, Carole? 
  What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, he said he was coming. 
  Looks like it. So how did he handle it to? 
  I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me. 
  Doesn't sound promising. 
  If you want I'll let him know if I run into him. 
  Excuse me, sir? 
  I'm afraid you can't smoke here. 
  Can't you see the notes here? 
  It says'No smoking'. 
  I'm so hungry. Shall we go eat now, Rick? 
  how about some dumplings? I just can't get enough of them. 
  well, what do you have in mind? 
  oh, it's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It was so spicy my eyes teared up! 
  sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well. 
  great. Let's go! 
  Oh, Ralph, I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space. Disasters have happened before. If the spaceship were out of order. . . 
  But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors? 
  What do you think is the real danger man faced in space? 
  Welcome. May I help you? 
  We have different colours of eye-shadow. May I know what colour you usually wear? 
  Yes, I see. How do you like this one? 
  Certainly. 
  Not from this brand, I'm afraid. 
  How about this one? 
  I was really glad to hear about your award, congratulations! 
  You'Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice. You definitely deserve it. 
  I haven't received my credit card bill yet. 
  My Master Card. 
  I never got it. 
  What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill? 
  Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault? 
  Thanks for everything. 
  Excuse me. I want to pay the bill. 
  Here you are. 
  No, I'll e paying for myself, but I have private medical insurance. 
  Thanks a lot. 
  I finally found an apartment that I want to rent. 
  I saw it in this ad for apartments in today's newspaper. 
  I really did, but what's so great about it is that it's really affordable. 
  Well, most importantly the apartment is beautiful. 
  The rent is $ 725 each month. 
  That's what I said when I found out how much the rent was. 
  May I help you? 
  How do you want to send it? 
  Is there anything valuable? 
  They are fragile articles. They must be packed in a proper strong box. Your light cardboard box won't do. 
  Yes. 
  Yes. Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English. You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms. 
  Have you written down your return address? 
  An exhibition of Picasso's paintings is being held. Do you want to go with me? 
  I understand how you feel, sir. But there simply isn't any room. The person who received your reservation call must have forgotten to write it down. I'm afraid it was just a mistake. She is new, you know. 
  I'm sorry, sir. I suggest you call them and explain the problem. I'm sure you'll find several other very good restaurants around here. 
  Not unless you'd like me to put you in the hall, sir. 
  So, what seems to be the problem, Bobby? 
  Did you cut yourself or knock it against something? 
  Can you describe the pain for me? Is it a sharp pain that comes and goes? Or is it a constant, dull pain that doesn't really ever go away? 
  Let me see those feet, Bobby. 
  Yes, I'd like to compare your right and left foot. Ah, the right foot is pretty red, and it looks bigger than the left one. It also feels warmer. 
  Well, I don't know for sure. It could be one of a couple of things. I'm going to send you up to the lab to get some blood tests. Check in to the lab on the third floor. I'm sending them some instructions. Come back down here as soon as it's finished. 
  Go downstairs to the first floor. It's right next to the elevators. 
  I need a pan.  
  Well, the bigger the better, I think.  
  Yes, that is big enough, but it's too heavy for me.  
  Oh, this is nice and light. But it has an aluminum handle.  
  Oh, yes. This is very nice. I'll take this one.  
  Cash. Oh, I almost forgot. I need a lid, too.  
  The Johnsons are on their way back. You remember them, don't you?  
  We met them in Bermuda last May.  
  The couple with the dogs-think back.  
  Well, I've invited them for brunch.  
  Hello. Capital Hotel. May I help you?  
  Sure. May I have your name please?  
  Would you hurry up? We're late. 
  Our flight leaves in less than 2 hours. Come on. 
  If you hadn't overslept, we wouldn't be so stressed out right now. 
  Well, it's definitely not my fault. 
  Did you check your pockets? 
  Why am I not surprised? OK, put on your shoes and let's get out of here. 
  Are you kidding me? A taxi will be way faster. We don't have time to argue about this. Let's just grab the first cab when we get downstairs. 
  What is it now? 
  Is that the Park Hotel? Reservation desk, please. 
  Yes, please. I'm phoning from the airport here in Los Angeles. I'd like to reserve a single room for tonight. 
  That's right. How much will that be? 
  Good. In that case, I'll take a room, please. 
  My name is Tony Chan. T-O-N-Y. 
  I'm arriving very soon. I'm waiting for a taxi to the hotel. 
  Hello is that Phil Taylor? 
  Hi Phil. I'm a Reporter for the Sun. I'm calling to ask you a few questions about the fire. Can you tell me how it happened? 
  Ah. 
  Oh no. 
  What did you do? 
  So what was the damage. 
  Good morning. You have reached the Monterrey Bay in. 
  Alright. What are the dates for that reservation? 
  OK. Would you like to book a room for another day? We are having a special deal in March if you book a room for 2 days. You get the third day for free. 
  I see. Well, I do hope you consider our hotel when you get some vacation time so that will be $280 returned to you. Would you like me to put it back on your visa? 
  Thanks for coming in today. Please have a seat. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Why do you think you are qualified for this job? 
  The duties of this job include answering the phones and sending emails. How are you with both of those things? 
  We also have some early mornings here in the studio. Sometimes you'll have to be here around 4:00 or 5:00 AM? How do you feel about that? 
  Do you have references I can call? 
  Great! Well, I think that's it. I'll give you a call back in the next few days to let you know our decision. 
  Oh, what a beautiful cat! What do you think? 
  Yes, but there so much work. Would you be willing to walk it every single day and clean up after it? 
  well. We're obviously not ready to get a pet yet. 
  Darling, has our TV set been repaired? 
  Oh, it's a long day without any TV. Have you paid the internet bill? 
  Oh dear. Think up something for us to do tonight, will you? 
  Pass me the newspaper. Thanks. There is a Western on at the Maple Theater. 
  There is a war movie on at the Silver Star Theater. But you don't usually like war movies, do you? 
  Wait, there is a film at the Globe Theatre named The Killer. 
  Then what about the comedy Three Men and a Lady. 
  The Bay theater at... Oh, at 7:30. 
  So what made you decide to become a cameraman? 
  And you've won several prizes for your work? 
  So what about plans for the future? Is Hollywood calling? 
  What do you like best about your job? 
  There are many art craft items in this shop. I suggest you take your time, and you might find something you like. 
  If you have any problem, please come to me. 
  You are an expert on it. That wood carving is very rare. But I'm so sorry. that is not for sell. 
  Do you have any special request? 
  So that means you are shopping for presents? 
  Actually, I think the paper-cuts is OK, because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it. They think that is a miracle. 
  I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country, you can pick the one you like best. 
  As a matter of fact, I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts. I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country. 
  can you squeeze me in sometime today? 
  I know what you ' re saying, but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy. 
  What can I do for you today? 
  Were you looking at a particular refrigerator? 
  This particular refrigerator is a very good choice. 
  Not only is it affordable, but it comes with all the appliances. 
  It has an ice maker, water dispenser, and plenty of room on the inside. 
  Go right ahead. 
  Hi, is this the Bread and Cheese Deli? 
  I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks. Can you deliver? 
  What's your plan for your future? 
  Have you had any previous experience? 
  Of course it counts. What kind of work did you do there? 
  In this office, we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus. If you take any leaves, we'll deduct money from your salary. 
  Office hours are nine to five-thirty. One hour for lunch. Do you have any questions? 
  We'll give you about 3000 to start. There'll be a trial period of three month. After six months, we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise. 
  I'll call you in a day or two, did you write down your phone number on your resume? 
  All right. Good-bye. 
  But how did you know I was working for WebTracker? 
  He couldn't have told you. Only a few people at WebTracker know about me. 
  I can't believe it. I can't believe I fell into your trap. 
  Last weekend I didn't want to go out either, so I stayed at home and played video games by myself. It was really fun! 
  Yeah, I'm really into video games. In fact, all my friends are on the Internet. I've never met any of them in the real world. 
  is this seat taken? 
  thanks. 
  yes, on a business trip. How about you? 
  yes, I went there once last summer. 
  I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway. 
  yes. There were always so many people. After taking the subway during the rush hour, you'll envy sardines in their cans. 
  that's a good idea. Wish you a great vacation! 
  You look tired. 
  Really? How come? 
  You shouldn't work so hard. 
  What do you mean? 
  What do you like to do in your spare time? 
  What kind of dance do you like? 
  Great. I am not interested in Chinese chess. It is too difficult for me. 
  OK, I will try. As for stamp, don't you think it is an expensive hobby? 
  I like gardening. I take care of them everyday. I like those flowers and the swing in my garden. If the weather is nice, I would like to lie on the lawn. 
  Which of the two do you think is better? I mean, what's the difference between them? 
  I only want it for the kitchen. I like to listen to the news at breakfast time. 
  Hmm. . . I'd like the cheaper one, please. Can I pay by cheque? 
  Come here! I can see the tall camphor trees from here. 
  This is a great botanical garden in the city. 
  Yeah, I agree. It makes you feel really good. 
  Do you mean the red flowers? They are peony flowers? 
  Yes, you like them very much. right? 
  I can help you with it 
  Well, that's all for the interview. Thank you for your interest in this job. 
  May I call you about our final decision? 
  We will get in touch with you by the end of next week. 
  We'll notify you if necessary. Goodbye. 
  Hello, John, please invite all our clients to the conference next week. 
  Get the clients'contact info from my Rolodex. 
  How about the Holiday Inn? 
  Well, the client is always right. 
  Please print out the meeting agenda for me to look over. 
  And make sure to return my Rolodex to my desk when you are done with it. 
  About my driving test, did I do well? 
  Are you telling me that I passed the test? 
  What did I mess up on? 
  Tell me. 
  That's not easy for me. 
  Am I still going to get my license? 
  How much is the admission fee for a student? 
  Here you are. Where is the museum guide? 
  Is it free? 
  Excuse me, could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station? 
  How often dose this bus go there? 
  I really can't wait that long. Are there any other buses that can take me there? 
  Where can I find the bus? 
  Thanks a lot. 
  Are we supposed to get off right here? 
  Where are we? 
  You said this was the right stop. 
  Did we get off the bus too early? 
  Why did you tell me to get off? 
  I really don't feel like walking. 
  What are your career goals, Miss Li? 
  Great! It sounds like you might be a good fit. As you know, we're one of the largest brokerage houses in the world. Our daily work is quite hectic, and we are looking for an assistant who can keep us organized. . . help keep the engines running smoothly, so to speak. Our hours are long, but the overtime pay is good. . . sort of makes up for the long hours. 
  Well, that's the problem. We never seem to have 'typical' days, but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer. There would also be a lot of telephone time, setting up appointment, and taking care of a lot of support work. 
  I would like high speed internet installed in my house. 
  I'd like to make an appointment right now. 
  I would like to have it done this Friday. 
  Is it possible for someone to come a little earlier? 
  How about Saturday? 
  Can you come over at 11 
  Do you know how late it is? 
  I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook. 
  Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late? 
  Regardless, all you had to do was give a call. 
  Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside. 
  That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules. 
  This is awful! It's like drinking saltwater! It's like drowning in the ocean! 
  OK, OK. 
  Maybe I'll run away first. 
  Well, this is a pleasant surprise. It seems to me we ran into each other here last week too. 
  Dear audiences, today we'll talk about divorce and its effect on children. Our guest is Jennifer Benzes. Thank you for coming, Jennifer. Do you mind saying something about your divorce? 
  Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives. 
  How? 
  You haven't thought of saving the marriage? 
  Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it. 
  Yet most people believe a hard marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think? 
  What do you want society to do for you? 
  Tina, are you coming to band practice this week? Our show is this Friday...only two days away! 
  Did you fix your guitar? My sister has a new guitar you can probably borrow if your guitar is still broken. 
  Why didn't you fix it sooner? We only have two days until our show. 
  While you are thinking about what you might like to order for dinner, would you like to order your drinks?  
  The wine list is posted right there on the board.  
  Yes, we have a wide selection of mixed drinks available from our bar.  
  Our most popular drinks are our Cuervo Gold margaritas.  
  Can I bring that to you on the rocks, or would you like it blended?  
  Salt or no salt?  
  How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read?  
  He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school.  
  No. But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there.  
  Come on. You're great at teaching and I know you will love him. He's adorable!  
  I was told to come to you to get a chest X-ray.  
  Then what should I do?  
  Should I just stand naturally?  
  Is this all right?  
  Where will you be going?  
  Is that it?  
  Oh, heavens, I look terrible. 
  Absolutely not. This shirt looked pretty nice on the shelf. But on my fat body, it looks terrible. 
  I like good eighties styles. Not bad eighties styles. 
  Very funny. Look, can we just get out of here please? Let's just try to find a more modern store where they might actually have something that doesn't make me look like some huge cartoon animal from the zoo. 
  I heard something terrible happen to your son last weekend. 
  Can he swim? 
  That's horrible. Did anyone notice what was happening? 
  You must have been in shock when you found out what was happening. 
  How is your mother feeling these days? 
  That's wonderful. When will you be back at your job? 
  Why don't you hire someone to do it? You'll be able to work and also have more free time. 
  You're a kind and thoughtful man. I admire you very much. 
  My car doesn't always start in the morning and it often makes me late for work. I think I'd better buy a new car. 
  Thank you, the last time I took my car to a garage. They didn't really settle the problem. 
  How are you Mrs. Brandon? 
  Not so good. I just lost my job today. 
  How are your students doing? 
  I remember you gave our class a hard final exam in my first year of college, many of us failed, but I really learned a lot from you and it must worked because I can speak very good English now. 
  You look tired. What time did you get up? 
  Oh, so late. What time did you go to bed last night? 
  Oh, so late. What did you do? 
  Maybe you should find some important things to do instead. If you were busy in other things, you would have no time to play it. 
  You, too. See you later. 
  Let's go over this plan again. 
  And that is mostly flat, right? 
  And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto, right? 
  It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long, long ride. 
  Ahhchooo! 
  No. Every spring time around April, I'm stricken with allergies. 
  Consider yourself lucky. 
  Well, as you just saw, I sneeze a lot. Also, my nose becomes very runny, my throat sometimes itches, and my eyes start to water. 
  No, it's not. So you don't have any type of allergies? 
  Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol. 
  That's pretty bad. 
  Let's have a look at the map first. 
  Let's buy some tickets. 
  Well, it's not as crowded as we expected, is it? 
  Is there anything worth watching on another channel? 
  Do you mind if we watch it. I ' d really like to see it. 
  Football game? Ok, and you know what comes on next? 
  Are you interested in watching it? 
  Oh, I am sorry. What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm? 
  Do you want to watch it? 
  I would love to rent this apartment. 
  How much are you asking for every month? 
  That is quite a lot of money for just one month. 
  What do you say to $ 850 a month? 
  It's either $ 850 or nothing at all. 
  Could you please go lower? 
  what are you listening to? Is that Beethoven or Mozart? 
  I think Beethoven's music is incredible. I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent, too. Do you believe that? 
  what other kind of music do you listen to? 
  to be honest, I think classical music is too complicated for me. 
  I like pop music. Do you? 
  I see what you mean. I think that's way I like it so much. 
  I've always been into it. Have you always liked classical music? 
  so, how did you become interested in it?

  Are you studying here? 
  What are you majoring in? 
  What do you think of the literature course? 
  I'm so excited! We have two weeks off! What are you going to do? 
  Well, my parents have rented a condominium in Florida. I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming.

  So, let's get started. tell me a bit about your educational background. 
  Interesting. And, your postgraduate studies?

  Interesting. . . 
  Excuse me, sir. Didn't you see the red light? 
  No, sir. The sign says No Turn on Red. 
  I am sorry, sir. But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy, PLS? I have to give you a ticket. 
  Sign here, PLS. You can appeal to the court within 14 days. This slip has all the information you need. Pls drive safely, sir. 
  What are you waiting for? Get on that bus quickly. 
  On the bus. The driver collects the fares. You'll have to take your luggage on board. 
  I have to do some shopping. 
  I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set. 
  I'm not sure. 
  I have no idea where to find one. 
  I would appreciate that. 
  Is the furniture at IKEA cheap? 
  What's the matter with me, Doctor? I feel so tired these days. 
  And what's the cause of that? 
  But I can't just slow down. 
  You mean I've got to lose weight? 
  Hello, my name's David Parker. I'm calling about the apartment advertised in the paper. Can you tell me something about it? 
  Where is it located? 
  Is it furnished? 
  How much is the rent? 
  You mean gas, electricity and heat? 
  Is there anything like management fee or parking fee? 
  Can I come and have a look at it today? 
  One o'clock sounds fine. See you then. 
  Hello, Barbara, welcome back. You look great. 
  How was your trip? 
  And Florence, what did you think of Florence? 
  No, I've never been to Italy. I'd really like to go to Roma. Well, the cars are in the car park. Is this all your luggage? 
  Barbara, what's in it? Books or stones? 
  did you go to university?  
  when did you graduate?  
  I just graduated from high school.  
  I'd like to get a BA, but I don't know where I should go.  
  yes, I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them.  
  the tuition is the same for all of them.  
  I think the course at Leeds University is interesting, but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical.  
  I'd really like to be in London, but it's the most expensive city in England to live in, so I don't know if I can afford to live there.  
  not yet.  
  that's a good idea.  
  Hi! Is that the new laptop you brought last week? It looks very nice.  
  Here? In this cafe? How can you do that?  
  That's great. Can you do it anywhere?  
  So, what programes do you have on your laptop?  
  I know you are keen on photography. It's very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, anywhere, at anytime!  
  Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today?  
  Was it caused accidentally or naturally? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa.  
  What is the international community doing to help?  
  How many countries have been affected?  
  I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran.  
  Does the newspaper say anything about casualties?  
  Ah, that's the forth ad that appears suddenly on my computer screen since I started working on my paper. 
  I can't afford to buy some fancy $10 software just so I can write my paper. 
  So that's $12 a year. 
  Well, no, Harriet. It'll be done in 3 weeks. But I'll be doing school work on this computer for 4 years before I graduate. 
  $30 for 4 years? 
  Thank you. The tea smells good. What is it called? 
  I've heard this name before, but I could never understand the tea classification. 
  It is said that different kinds of tea have different health benefits, isn't it? 
  There seems to be a lot to know about tea. You must tell me more about tea culture in the future. 
  What time is it? We're going to be late! 
  But I thought we had to be at the restaurant by 7:30 for the surprise party, we will never make it there with all this evening traffic. 
  I saw a beautiful fish in the market the other day, it was orange and blue. I'm thinking of buying some next Sunday. 
  In that round bottle over there. 
  So are the fish. 
  Really? 
  That might be quite expensive. 
  Is there anything else that I ought to get? 
  Hi, Mary. 
  Peter, Peter Parker from your math class. 
  Fine, thanks. Actually I'm working on our assignment and I can't seem to figure out the last problem. And the teaching assistant is out of town. So I was wondering if you could help me. 
  Ah, that's bad for me. I have a meeting for the Torch. 
  The Torch, you know, the campus literary magazine. It comes out once a month. 
  I'll give you a copy of our magazine. So anyway, what about tomorrow? After lunch, baby? 
  Hi Joe, many people in our Department or leaving for Thanksgiving. What are you going to do? 
  I am going to do some traveling with my family. 
  Toronto and on our way we're going to visit my aunt Betty in Kingston. 
  2 days. I have a get together party with my college friends in Toronto. Oh, I'm afraid I've got to go now. My husband is waiting for me and we'll have to pick up Daniel from school. Have a nice holiday, Joe. 
  Hello, how can I help you today? 
  Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw.

  Welcome to China, Mr. Smith. 
  I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats. 
  Great! B, most of the items listed are available this year. I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts, so as to enable our timely delivery. 
  What's the proposal? 
  Good idea! In this way, our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided. 
  Cigarette? 
  Sorry, here. 
  I'll stand in with you if you like. I'Ve got nothing else to do. 
  It's nice and bright today, isn't it? 
  How about winter? 
  It's boring, right? 
  Do you get much rain during the summer? 
  So you should bring an umbrella often. 
  Adam. I'm sorry. 
  Yes, But I couldn't help it. I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus. The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam. It was one thing after another. 
  Yes. But those are the rush in that moment. And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters. 
  Well, no. I thought I ' Ve finish in five minutes. and I didn't want to be difficult about just few minutes, if I hadn't been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry. 
  What can I do for you today? 
  Can I do anything else for you? 
  We don't allow people to check out magazines. 
  It's just a policy of ours. 
  You may check out books or videos. 
  You will have to just read it in the library. 
  Hey, Mary, nice to see you again. I heard you're going back home to the U. S. . 
  You're so thoughtful. Wish you a good trip home. And we'll miss you. 
  So, Monica, what do you feel like doing this afternoon? 
  That's too bad. I hate sand storms too. It can be worse than any kind of bad weather. 
  It is not an easy job. The government is working on it. Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital. Also, methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought. But of course, it will not work overnight. So, have you come out with a new plan for today? 
  Helen, you must be excited at going to America to study. 
  What do your classmates think of it? 
  How long will you study there. 
  Which university will you go to? 
  Good luck! 
  Hi charles, I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian. 
  Yeah, I am having a party this saturday night, a sort of house warming, and i want to invite you. are you busy? 
  Around seven. 
  No, but thanks for offering, actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat, do you have any? 
  Don't worry, I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty. 
  Good morning. May I help you, sir? 
  Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft? 
  How do I use the powder? 
  How do I use the eye-drop and ointment? 
  Well, I see. Thanks. 
  Front Desk, may I help you? 
  Is there anything uncomfortable in your room? 
  May I have your room number, sir? 
  OK. Mr. Wang, may I send a room attendant to check it for you first? 
  ( 15 minutes later ) Mr. Wang, we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience. The maintenance might last for a long time, may I offer you another room? 
  How many foreign languages can you speak? 
  What do you think of your English? 
  Can you speak English fluently? 
  Did you take TOEFL or GRE? 
  When did you begin to learn English? 
  Do you think your English is good enough to do office work? 
  How much will our order from your factory be? 
  I'm afraid I can't wait that long. Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure? 
  Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units. 
  Your estimated is seems a little high to me, we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit. 
  Hello, is this house keeper? 
  This room 117, and we have just checked in. 
  Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet. So would you send one of your house keepers to clean up our room. 
  Our room number is 117 and my name is Terry Chen. 
  Do you have any shoes like these? 
  Size five. 
  Black. 
  But my sister bought this pair last month. 
  No, she bought them in the U. S. 
  Can you get a pair for me please? 
  They look very uncomfortable. 
  Passport, please! 
  Are you Chinese? 
  Where in China are you from? 
  There are a lot of people from China visiting right now. 
  How long do you plan to stay? 
  All right. Here's your passport. Welcome to Australia. 
  Can I help you? 
  They are 12 dollars 50 cents each. 
  Just a minute. No. I'm sorry. We haven't. What about the black one? 
  How about the pink one? 
  That's 12 dollars 50 cents then please. 
  May I help you? 
  What's wrong with them? 
  I can see they are simply worn out. Would you like the same color? 
  How about this light brown pair? 
  They certainly look charming. 
  Then try on another pair of the similar style. 
  Yes. Would you like both pairs? 
  Oh, no. they don't. The second pair is half price. Shall I put them both in the box for you? 
  What I should remind you is that your boy is sometimes 25 minutes late for the class. 
  Hi, David. Haven't seen you for ages. How are you getting along with your work? 
  What are you going to do then? 
  I've been very successful as a dancer. I like this kind of life. It is so exciting. 
  No, but I've decided to open a dance school once I've moved to the top. A lot of young dancers need better training, don't they? 
  How are you doing today?  
  I'm absolutely lovely, thank you.  
  I haven't been better. How about yourself?  
  Where are you going to school?  
  How do you like it so far?  
  I wish you luck.  
  What kind of car is best for me?  
  The compact? Why do you think that one is better than the others?  
  That's true. What kind of safety features are we talking about?  
  You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models?  
  With the cost of gasoline these days, that is a big plus. I think this model may be just what I'm looking for.  
  Have you ever been involved in the auditing work?  
  How long did it take you to become an auditor?  
  Whew! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line.  
  Wow! Your calligraphy is very beautiful. It was worth the wait!  
  What does it say?  
  That's very nice. Is it for sale?  
  Really? Then what do you do with it?  
  Wow! Really? Are you sure? Now I'll have a lucky year!  
  They got a divorce at last.  
  You said it. Love buit on the sand will soon be on the rocks.  
  Most of our customers are foreigners. How many foreign languages can you speak, Elizabeth?  
  And how well can you speak them?  
  And how about your Spanish?  
  I see. Well, we have a lot of Spanish customers, but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here.  
  Ah, where am I? 
  I want to go to the Science Museum. But I've been lost for the past few hours, and I can't use these ticket machines. 
  All right, oh, and how often do the trains come around this time of day? 
  Ok, and where do I get off the train? 
  Ok, I got it, thanks for your help. 
  Have you got the list of who is coming to the party? 
  Everyone's looking forward to it. I'll pick you up from the office and will go there together, shall we? 
  Excuse me, could you tell me where the nearest post office is? 
  Thank you. Could you give me more information? 
  How long will it take to get there if I walk? 
  Oh, that's too long. 
  I think getting a taxi might be better. Thanks a lot. 
  I'm planning to go to Canada on vacation. 
  First, I'll spend a few days in Vancouver. Then I'll take a train through the Rocky Mountains. 
  Then I'll fly to Toronto and take a bus to Niagara Falls. I will take a boat under that huge waterfall. 
  Well, I hope I don't get seasick. I'll finish my trip in Nova Scotia. I'd like to bike around some small fishing villages. 
  You are not happy, are you? 
  What makes you unhappy? 
  Why? I guess they must love you very much. 
  Oh, I see. There is a generation gap between your parents and you. 
  It refers to a lack of understanding between parents and child. 
  But have you ever tried to understand them? 
  Hi Joe. How was your trip? 
  How did you get there? 
  Oh, terrible. 
  Hello, reservation desk. How can I help you? 
  And what kind of room would you like ma'am? And we got single rooms, double rooms, standard rooms, sweets and Delux sweets. 
  $79 a night. 
  What date would you check in ma'am? 
  How long do you plan to stay? 
  Could you give me your name and phone number? 
  Thanks, what time will you arrive? 
  Very good, your reservation confirmation number is NB 13579. Thank you for booking in our hotel. Can I help you with anything else today? 
  My program is a course in automotive repair. We teach people from the age of 16 through to adults. We're located on a high school campus. It's vocational, which means that we train people in specific skills that they could use in a job. 
  Today's a work day. So when I go back into the shop, I have all my students working on a project. First, Jack is going to get the air tools out and jack up a car. He's going to take a tyre off that car with the air impact. Every student is an individual that comes into my program. All of them think that they're going to be able to fix their own cars. They all have it as a goal that they're going to get out of the program. And then, as part of my introduction to the class, I'll let them know some of the other things that they'll all get, which include consumer understanding of how the car works. 
  We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade. But don't worry, it won't cause too much inconvenience. We're going to do it over the weekend. 
  We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time. It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours. If everything goes according to plan, it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday. 
  Excuse me. I need to refill this prescription. 
  Yes, I need to refill it today. 
  I was worried about that. I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not. 
  Listen. This is an emergency. I tried to call my doctor, but he is out of town. So I can't see him in time. I need this medicine. It is for skin condition. I've run out.Can you just refill it once more? 
  But I need it. Please. Refill it for me just this once. I can go to the doctor around ten days from now. Then I'll have another prescription. 
  But I have a prescription. I just need more of it. 
  Oh, it will be so expensive! I have a special medical plan, and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor. 
  This is ridiculous! In Taiwan, it is much easier to get medicine when I need it. 
  Do you consider yourself a good mother? 
  How can you manage to do both? I mean, it is so hard to be a working mother. 
  Does your husband feel the same? 
  Why do you think you are qualified for this position? 
  Great. Then what's your technical post title now? 
  Do you take the original certificate with you? 
  Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs? 
  Taxi! Taxi! 
  I'd like to go to the railway station please. 
  Is it a long run to the station? 
  The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day, are they? 
  Is it the rush hour? 
  No, I'm not. Would you please drive slowly and carefully? 
  Look at the catalogue, John. I think I want to get this red blouse 
  Yah, but it doesn't have a red one. 
  Yes! 
  What's your favorite hobby? 
  What kinds of books do you like to read? 
  By the way, would you like to see movies? 
  What do you do in your spare time? 
  I just like to sleep like a lazy cat. 
  Is this seat taken? 
  Thanks. 
  Yes, on a business trip. How about Yuu? 
  Yes, I Went there once last summer. 
  I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway. 
  Yes. These were always so many people. After taking the subway during the rush hour, you'll envy sardines in their cans. 
  That's a good idea. Wish you a great vacation! 
  How are you doing? 
  I'm awesome. 
  I've been on here for like, 15 minutes. 
  Not much, I have a car. 
  I sure do. 
  I'm waiting till our President gets out of office, and the gas prices go down. 
  May I take your order? 
  The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good. 
  Do you want some dessert? 
  Single or double? 
  Your total comes to $ 36. 78. 
  There's a problem with your card. 
  I believe it was declined. 
  Do you have another card I could try? 
  Do you have cash, perhaps? 
  You're not going to be able to take these items today. 
  I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States. 
  Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping. It was so big. I think I could get lost if I went there alone. 
  Not really many. I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets, so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain. 
  I have heard about it while in China. it is called a ' yard sale '. I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big ' yard sale '. 
  Hi dude, you look upset, what's up? 
  What's the problem? 
  Well, you can simply tell them you want to sleep, or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down. 
  I understand. I used to live in a dorm with four people. I was great in some aspects. We always went out and and had fun together. But on the other hand, when I wanted some quiet time, and people kept talking and laughing aloud, it was torturous. For me a room to myself, even a small one, is ideal. Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody. 
  Are you going to vote this Tuesday? 
  Have you figured out who you're going to vote for? 
  Why is that? 
  Is that right? 
  That's great! 
  Hopefully, he will be. 
  I wonder if you could help me find something for my daughter. 
  I think that would be perfect. 
  In fact, she prefers Macs. How much is one? 
  She's going to be so happy. Let me have one. 
  I'll pay for it with my VISA. 
  Are there any extras that she needs? 
  You've been so helpful. Thank you. 
  What is the proper way to handle a napkin at dinner? 
  How about at a formal dinner? 
  There's a lot of traffic on the street. Is this the shopping district? 
  What is the largest building on the left? 
  Do you buy everything in the same store? That's very handy, isn't it? It saves a lot of time. I need some clothes. 
  That's a beautiful theatre on the corner. What do all the signs in front of it mean? 
  Is that the post office across the street? 
  What do you like most about your new job? 
  That sounds great. I wish my company did that. 
  Hi, Wendy. 
  No, not at all. I've been a couch potato lately, killing time by watching TV. Oh, by the way, did you hear the news? 
  They are going to turn the city square into an amusement park. 
  You really are? In my opinion, the square is 100 times better than an amusement park. 
  The square is a symbol of our city and it is a nice place to have a walk for everybody. 
  I know what you mean, but don't you think that we will no longer have peace and quiet once the amusement park opens? 
  So what? 
  Dad! 
  Can I have a really good snack? 
  Uh, it's three thirty. 
  Candy? 
  Candy. 
  A sandwich? A spinach sandwich? 
  Uh, today. 
  Our flight will be delayed by 6 hours. That means it won't be leaving until 3:30 in the afternoon. 
  Let's find some seats in the quiet part of the terminal to take a nap. 
  May I help you?  
  What size do you wear? These dresses are on sale.  
  Come this way. Here's the dressing room.  
  It looks nice. And it's not expensive.  
  It's only $20.  
  Can I help you, sir?  
  Let me give you a hand. The author is. . .  
  Oh, yes. Here it is.  
  Yes, we have both the paperback and hardcover. which would you want to buy?  
  It's $25.  
  Hi Mary, how's it going?  
  Terrible. It must be something serious. You two are such close friends.  
  Really? What happened?  
  That's pretty harsh.  
  You know she probably feels just as bad.  
  Well, in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want.  
  Hi, Mary. You look pale today. What's the matter with you?  
  You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest. I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon.  
  Do you want to hear a funny joke?  
  Well, you'll see.  
  OK, an Englishman, a Scotsman, and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert, and they could only take one thing with them.  
  So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment.  
  Hang on, I haven't finished yet.  
  Well, as I was saying, they showed each other what they had decided to bring. The Englishman had brought some water. 'If we get thirsty, we'll have something to drink, ' he said. The Scotsman brought a map. 'If we get lost, we'll be able to find our way. ' The Irishman had brought a car door.  
  Yep. A car door. 'Why the door? ' the others asked him. 'Well, ' he said, 'If it gets hot, we can open the window. ' Do you get it?  
  I'm now at the airport to meet Mr. Dale, who is arriving at 3:00 PM. There will be some calls for me while I'm away. So please take a message. 
  Well, if the plane arrives on time, and then I'll be back around 5:30 PM. 
  I'll call it again. Just to make sure. 
  What's up? 
  Maybe you could just borrow someone else's notes and photo copy them or something. It'll help take the stress off your hands. Trying to keep up with the lectures on the board. 
  Maybe you could just bring a tape recorder to class. You could try and sit at the front or near the professor, so that the sound will be clear enough to listen to afterwards. You can borrow my recorder if you want. 
  Is there any place in the hotel where we can amuse ourselves? 
  That sounds good. But is that the only place to go? 
  I don't plan to play sports. I'd like a place to relax myself. 
  Oh, great! Thank you very much. 
  Excuse me. Could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema? 
  Will it take me long to get there? 
  Thank you very much. 
  Merry Christmas, Bill. 
  What are you doing there on the computer? 
  That's pretty interesting. Did you get one from Haven? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number. 
  Yeah, that would be great. Thanks. 
  Thanks million. 
  Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for? 
  Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore? 
  I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed. 
  Yea, I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either. 
  Good afternoon. Is there a vacant room here? 
  A single, preferably with a bath. 
  For four days or so. 
  I hope it's quiet. I hate noise. 
  How much does it cost per day? 
  All right. I'll take the room. 
  OK. 
  No problem. Here you are. 
  What seems to be the problem? 
  Where does it hurt the most? 
  How long has it felt like this? 
  Do you have a history of stomach pain? 
  Well, I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away. 
  Wow, Is winter always this cold in Taiwan? 
  No, I am from south California. This is my first real winter. 
  What's the temperature today anyway? 
  Are you ready to order, sir? 
  Of course. Here you are. 
  Our seafood is fresh. I recommend shrimp with garlic. 
  Craig, what do you do for work? 
  What school do you go to? 
  That's a good school. What do you study? 
  How long have you been studying English? 
  That's a long time. 
  No wonder your English is so good. 
  I see. Talking with other people is very important. 
  I'm having a party tonight at my apartment. You should come. 
  B, what's in your hand? 
  Why do you read them? 
  I got your meaning. Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks. 
  I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired. I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste. 
  Shall we have a drink someday? 
  Don't have some relation with him. You know, he is not a kind man. 
  If you attack him, be sure you'll get a Roland for an Oliver. 
  Thank you so much. I can't take this. 
  What did she mean just now about raising pigs? 
  Haha. I get it. That's funny. Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady. 
  Are you busy with your work? 
  Yes, I'm very busy, too. Sometimes I work overtime. 
  Just so so. But we can travel twice every year. 
  Yes, we won't travel again until October. 
  Is this the A housing office? 
  I was hoping to get into something on campus, but my friend told me that everything is full. 
  Please. And in the mean time, can I look at apartments available in the area from this office? 
  Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them? 
  I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night. 
  Kate. She said she was too excited to go to sleep. 
  It's true. Guess what we were talking about last night. 
  Yeah, how do you know about that? 
  Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space? 
  But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy. If galaxies are moving apart from each other, how can they collide? 
  Wow, you're really informative. Thanks a lot. 
  There are so many record players here. That is hard to choose. 
  I'd rather get one with separated speakers. They give a clear sound. 
  That's right. Now this one looks alright? It's a detached or do you prefer this one? It's Sony. 
  You are married to a foreigner, huh? So what's it like? 
  Yeah, I know what you mean. The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, not to mention two people from different cultures. 
  Oh, so he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, then? 
  What does he look like? Can people tell? 
  This little wooden stick is called a tee. 
  For the first drive, put the golf ball on the tee, and push the tee into the ground. 
  Pick up a wood and hold it like this, interlocking your fingers. 
  Position yourself, swinging the club, watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can. 
  Not too bad. The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible. 
  Mary, do you remember when we met? 
  And I came up and asked to sit by you. . . 
  Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel? I heard it's and excellent place to stay and has good facilities. 
  Do they have a swimming pool? 
  What's the service like? 
  It sounds perfect. Did you have any complaints at all? 
  I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world. 
  Thanks. Was there a mina bar in the room? 
  One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips. 
  Excuse me. May I see that laptop for a moment? 
  No, the one on the left. Yes, that's the one. . . . Thank you. 
  That's impressive! What's the sale price? 
  Can you help me with my timesheet? 
  No, I don't know where to find one. 
  Yes, I can do that. 
  No, I don't know what that is. 
  Yes, I understand how to do this. 
  That was easy! 
  You two are so health-conscious! 
  Why not! Before you know it, I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head! 
  Thanks for the carrot juice, Mrs. Schmidt. I've got to run to class! 
  Did your meal meet with your approval? 
  How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal? 
  On this evening's dessert list, we have chocolate mousse cake, homemade fresh strawberry shortcake, and a spicy rum apple crisp. 
  One dessert will serve two, so would you like to split a second one? 
  How about some coffee and tea as well? 
  I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away. 
  Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you?

  Wise decision. that is 400 yuan. You'll find it's totally worth it. 
  Welcome, young man. No offence, but I haven't seen you here before. 
  Okay then. You are the younger customer here ever. 
  It's the marketing's fault, I suppose. What do you want to do? 
  That's a long way to go, I'm afraid. First of all, you gotta grow up. 
  Sure. Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope. 
  Please change your clothes first! 
  Sorry, but no jeans here. 
  Hello,this is Susan speaking. Is Mr. Brown in, please? 
  Hi,Mr. Brown. Your son Ted missed the school trip this morning. Do you know why? 
  Why did he get up late? Didn't he have a clock? 
  Well,why did he wake up at such a late hour? Did he go to bed late last night? 
  Why didn't you ask him to go to bed early? 
  You should really change his sleeping habits. Otherwise it will happen again. 
  So what do you think you are going to do when you graduate, John? 
  Is that what your dad does? 
  How about you? What are you interested in doing? 
  Yeah, what subject are you good at? 
  Good morning, sir. Can I help you? 
  May I have your name, sir, please? 
  Just a moment, sir, while I look through our list. Yes, we do have a reservation for you, Mr. Bradley. Would you please fill out this form while I prepare your key card for you? 
  Sure. Here you are. 
  You can just skip that. I'll put in the room number for you later on. 
  Let me see...name, address, nationality, forwarding address, passport number, place of issue, signature and date of departure. Oh, here, sir. You forgot to put in the date of your departure. Here let me fill it in for you. You are leaving on...? 
  Now everything's in order. And here is your key, Mr. Bradley. Your room number is 1020. It is on the 10th floor and the daily rate is $90. Here is your key card with all the information on your booking, the hotel services and the hotel rules and regulations on it. Please make sure that you have it with you all the time, as you need to show it when you sign for your meals and drinks in the restaurants and the bars. You also need to show it when you collect your key from the Information Desk. 
  And now if you are ready, Mr. Bradley, I'll call the bell-boy and he'll take you to your room. 
  Welcome. Last month big leap in new job, some 300, 000 plus, is a huge increase over what the country has seen in the past 6 months when the average growth has been just 75, 000 new jobs a month. For a closer look at what's happening, we turn to Lisa Lynch, an economics professor at Tofts University. Lisa Lynch, when you look at these numbers, do you think job creation is on the rise? 
  What do you see in the numbers? Who's getting the new jobs? 
  What's going on between you and Charlie? Did you have a fight or something? 
  Why don't you have a heart-to-heart talk with him? 
  What can I do for you, sir?  
  Fruit juice, cakes and refreshments, and everything.  
  Any cereal, sir?  
  And eggs?  
  How do you want your eggs?  
  Anything more, sir?  
  Excuse me, is there a table for 8 right now?  
  Well, since there are some small square tables, could we put two tables together?  
  I am totally fed up with my boss. He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments. This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment.  
  He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out, referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling. I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment.  
  You're missing the point. It's about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It's his attitude that needs to be changed, not just his words.  
  Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.  
  You got it! I have a new job, I'm living in a new city, with new friends! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.  
  Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, it's just that I've been smoking since I was sixteen, and I think it's time to stop.  
  One last thing, I've decided to come out of the closet.
