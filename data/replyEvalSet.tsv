  I ' Ve been having trouble breathing lately. 
  No, I haven ' t had a cold. I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe. 
  No, I don ' t have any allergies that I know of. 
  It happens a lot when I work out. 
  Thank you for your help, doctor.
  Sure. What time do you want to go? 
  That sounds good. Today we work on Legs and forearm. 
  I'm on a weekly schedule. You're messing everything up. 
  Aright. I'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then.
  Of course. Did you? 
  That's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently? 
  I'm serious, have you? 
  I really want to go to the movies this weekend. 
  I really don't want to go by myself. 
  No, I think I'm going to go to the movies.
  Why? You said I was hot when smoking. 
  Smoking is killing. I know. 
  I don't believe it. 
  Of course I know it, but you know it's hard to quit smoking. . . 
  Yes, ma'am. Whatever you say.
  Sure, Sherry. Sorry to have kept you waiting. If you hadn't told me, I probably would have just forgotten all about them. 
  There you are.
  Yeah? I guess so. I spent the weekend at beach. 
  Some friends of my parents live out there, and they invited me there. 
  I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down. 
  I wanted to, but the water is too cold, and I just wetted in up to my knees. 
  It looks like you could use it. Don't tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.
  Of course. You see, almost everyone has some kind of hobby 
  I like taking photos out of door. 
  Yes, I usually develop and print all my own photos. 
  Yes, simple as it is. It does work.
  What? How happy you life is! I do envy you. 
  Maybe you are right.
  I like it. It makes the city feel alive. I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans. 
  I see your point, but if companies didn't spend money on advertising, no one would hear about their products. I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying. I don't like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying. 
  Yes, that annoys me too. With billboards, you can look away, but with broadcasts, you can't avoid them. I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign. 
  That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products. They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty.
  I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in, like football. 
  Why do you care? Women and men are different all around. I don't think they can be compared. 
  Well, I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports. 
  Are you suggesting that anyone can be?
  Yes, there are many cities where it's almost always warm. San Diego, for example. 
  Many. Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year. 
  Most people grow accustomed to the climate, but there are many others who complain about it all the time. 
  Several. Two good examples are Seattle, in the state of Washington, and Portland, Oregon. 
  In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter. Boston and Chicago are two of them. 
  Oh, no. On the contrary, there are many beautiful days, especially in the spring and fall.
  Thank you. 
  Thank you very much. Mr. George. As a newcomer, I understand that you have your consideration and I am satisfied with the raise. 
  Thank you again. I'll keep doing my best.
  Thanks. Dad, but I can manage it myself. 
  Yes, I know. The problem is that I can't find it. Where did you put it? 
  Oh, yes, here it is. 
  What's up? 
  No. Dad. We have a tour guide. 
  No, I won't get sick. I promise. Ok. I've finished. Bye, Dad. See you! 
  Dad, that's all right. I don't think it will rain. And it doesn't make any sense to take that many things on a trip. Besides I like to travel light. Bye!
  Yes, will you keep our bags until 6 p. m. ? 
  Yes, we checked out just now. 
  Is this all right? 
  Thanks a lot.
  What's the problem, Ms. Murphy? 
  I'm sorry. Ms. Murphy. I'll re-work it. Can I give it back to you this afternoon?
  Are you sure? How do you know? 
  Well, I heard that if you drink enough beer, you can speak foreign languages better. . . 
  Maybe. . .
  Good afternoon. It's very nice to see you again. 
  I'm much better. The stomachache is gone, and the doctor is about to give me another endoscope examination to see whether the ulcer has healed. 
  How beautiful they are! Thank you so much. 
  You're so thoughtful! 
  Thank you for coming. Good - bye.
  Yes. I feel terrible. I have been coughing for the whole morning. 
  Yes. I feel chilly and sluggish. 
  No. This is my first day abroad. I am not sure what is wrong with me. 
  Thank you very much.
  That's true. You need to take some time off to relax. 
  When are you going to take your vacation? 
  I really envy you. You know I'm not taking my vacation until December.
  It is so popular among people to preserve health now, so I read some books about health food. 
  Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy. 
  Warm water can be good for your stomach, which is empty at that moment. And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system. 
  Yogurt, because it has protein, vitamins and it is acidic. If you drink it everyday, your stomach will be more comfortable.
  On this occasion, most people do. 
  She is a beautiful bride. 
  Are you crying? 
  Harris and Anne are perfect for each other. 
  You and Tom also make a great couple. 
  For the wedding? 
  Try to catch this bouquet then.
  Now that you mention it, I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop, too. Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine. 
  You sure have a lot of discs here. 
  To tell you the truth, I'm strictly into classical music. You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart, do you? 
  Well, speaking of history, let's get back to the books. We'Ve got an exam tomorrow, remember?
  Yes, there are three stops left. 
  Well, you will get there in about a quarter of an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy. 
  Sure, madam. I'll remind you.
  Pretty good. How are you doing? 
  I'm sorry to hear that. 
  They are very nervous about their final test. 
  Thank you for saying so.
  I'm just glad to see you so happy, Gary! 
  Wow, you'd better not. Before you ask her to marry you, maybe you should ask her out on a second date. Only one date is not enough for you to know each other well.
  Yes. Are there any spare rooms here? 
  That might be more rooms than I need. I don't have much furniture.
  Drive two blocks and turn left. Continue on until you reach Heath Street and turn right. Then turn left at the second stop light. You can't miss it.
  No problem.  
  You mean the white building near the playground?  
  That is the library. And it has more than 1, 000, 000 books.  
  You know, our school is divided into two parts, the junior high school and the senior high school. That is the new classroom building for our senior high school.  
  Yes. There is a large swimming pool, but it is only available in summer.  
  I believe that you can make your dream come true. 
  What size pan were you thinking of?  
  Well, this one might work for you.  
  Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size.  
  Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle.  
  I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay?  
  Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan. 
  Hi, Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn't you meet me there?  
  Don't you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment.  
  Why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions?  
  It's okay. I don't want to go now. We've already missed ten minutes of the movie. I don't want to see a movie without watching the beginning. 
  Yes. Sit down, please. How did you learn about our company?  
  Why would you like to work with us?  
  Oh, really? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected?  
  That's fine. Thanks for coming to see us. I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week. 
  Our dog Rusty is lost. Someone left the backyard gate open and he got out. My daughter is so upset right now. 
  Well, they haven't seen him. They said they would call me if they find our dog, but I don't expect miracles. It's 2 days and... 
  He's wearing his sweater. He's brown with white spots and... Sorry, 'm not thinking straight. You know, he's a big part of our family. We got him when he was a little puppy. I'm just worried he was stolen or is injured somewhere. 
  Rusty! Come here boy! Oh, Glenn, I can't thank you enough. I owe you a big favor.
  I don't know. I think it's just boring. I don't like the workbooks because the lessons talk about baby things. I'm not a little child. I want to learn something more exciting. 
  Oh, what's that? 
  Wow, that's great, but, won't it be harder for me to learn English if I'm listening to so many different ways of speaking the language? 
  I can't wait to get started. Thank you, Miss Winters.
  Sorry, Mr. Black. I'm trying to make them quiet. 
  Sorry, sir. Believe me, everything will be all right.
  Yeah. Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian. She's almost driving Li Na crazy. 
  She is as meek as a lamb. She never goes against anyone or anything. She's as good as gold, you know?
  Fine, they are colorful and tasty. 
  Yes, I did. I have never tasted anything like this. 
  No, thanks. I'm full. 
  No, thanks. I'm on diet. 
  Ice cream, please.
  Yes. But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast. 
  I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach. I want to rent one. 
  No, but it looks fun. I always wanted to try it. 
  Sure. What? 
  But I always wanted to try it. 
  Well, I will see. How was your day at the office?
  And? 
  Poor child!
  Yeah. Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues. 
  They could generally be divided into two categories 
  Yeah. They are emitted directly into urban water supplies. 
  Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater. 
  Sure. It's an issue asking for everyone's participation.
  Yeah, get off the bus. 
  I'm really not sure. 
  I don't think this is right. 
  Yeah, we did get off too early. 
  I messed up. 
  You want to wait for the next bus?
  Go to gate 18. The plane is now boarding. You must hurry. 
  Instead of walking, you can take this shuttle to get you there faster. 
  No, I'll call the attendants at the gate. I will tell them you're on your way. 
  You are welcome. Have a safe trip.
  That means they have tapered legs. 
  Mine are, too. 
  Yeah. Let's just lounge around!
  Do you have any rooms available next Saturday and Sunday night? 
  A double room, please. 
  My name is Monica Cellar. 
  Thank you.
  Your price is rather out of line, much higher than we expected. We can't buy with your offer. 
  When we say your prices are much too high, we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent. If we are to place an order with you. I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient. 
  There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great. 
  Ok. I can settle for that.
  Really? I'm glad to hear that. 
  Thank you again for your visit. We are looking forward to your reply. 
  We are happy that we have established business relations. I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other. 
  You are very nice and helpful. Hope to see you again. 
  OK, I think it's time for you to check in. If you run into any difficulty, we'll be here to assist you immediately. 
  Goodbye.
  Hello. Is there anything I can do for you? 
  Certainly, I'll be very happy to help you. Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals. 
  If you open a fixed account, the interest rate is higher. 
  You may withdraw the money at any time. You just need to present your deposit book. 
  OK. Do you have your ID card on you? 
  Good. Everything is done. Here is your deposit book and ID card. 
  It's my pleasure.
  Hi Laura, long time no see! What have you been up to lately? 
  Much the same except I do have some big news. 
  No, really, what have you been doing these past few weeks? The last time I saw you, you were looking for a new job. 
  A step up in the big business world. 
  Right, sometimes you can do your best and it seems like the others don't know you exist. I hope the money's better. 
  I am getting married. 
  That was then and this is now. You've got to meet Andrea, she's great! 
  We weren't. We've just been dating for two weeks now. 
  I know. I can't help it. I just know she's the one. 
  Thanks, I'm glad to hear you feel way.
  I was at home asleep. 
  I was sick. I had a fever. I couldn't get out of bed. 
  I'm going now. I just came here to speak to my professor. 
  He said that I'd be able to take a make-up. 
  I have to stop at the drugstore on the way. I need some aspirin. 
  I have to walk. I didn't bring my car. 1 didn't think I'd be able to drive today. 
  OK. Thanks.
  Yeah, that is a great idea. Maybe Sara would like to come along with us. 
  Why? You are kidding! You know, she loves watching the sea. 
  What happened? 
  I am sorry to hear that. Well, What do you think? Should we take some food? 
  We should also take some drinks like Coke and beer. 
  OK. Please don't forget to give me a call and let's go down together.
  We have several part-time jobs available here, Would you like to look through the list? 
  Please fill out the form.
  He asked me to beef up in the work.  
  Nothing, thanks. I am just not in the mood these days. 
  that depends. What is it?  
  I'd love to help you out, but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well. I had to get a new engine put into my car, and that ate up my savings.  
  let's see, I've got about $50 to get me through the weekend. I can only spare about $20. I would give you more if I had it, I just don't have much money to my name right now.  
  that'd be great. Thanks! What time should I come over?  
  see you then! 
  You've got to be joking! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants, and if she saw Myra cheating, she certainly had the right to say so.  
  You're right. If I were the teacher, I wouldn't have done that. 
  I'm so worried. I haven't heard from my sister for 2 weeks. 
  Normally at least once a week. But she's now a volunteer teacher in a mountain village in Africa. I can only write her. 
  I hope so. 
  Maybe you're right. Thanks, Jason.
  It was great. My friend and I travelled throughout India. 
  Most People there speak English. But there were some remote places in the mountains where we had to learn a few words to communicate. Usually it was easy. One time, though, it got a little awkward. I was asking a baker for some bread and I said 'I want money' instead of 'I want bread'. The words for money and bread were so similar that I got them mixed up. 
  He looked a little scared but my friend quickly cleared up the confusion. We ended up becoming friends with the guy and he introduced us to more young people. Whenever we told the story of our meeting, it would make everyone laugh.
  Yes, I already have an interview schedule with the manager on Wednesday. 
  In a building which is very close to where you work, we can meet up then, and I'll tell you about it over some coffee.
  There is one, just 2 blocks from here, on the west end of the Ivy Street. So are you a Christian if you don't mind me asking? 
  I see. Actually, one of the priests in that church is my cousin. I can arrange a meeting between you 2 if you like. 
  It's OK. I'm glad I could be of some help to my new working partner.
  Absolutely. Here it is. 
  Please do, the fitting-room is over there. 
  I'm sorry. We don't have this color in your size. We have some green ones in your size. Would you please have a look at this green one? 
  It's 486 yuan.
  yeah, I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long. I'm starving! 
  what would you rather have, samosas or poppadoms? 
  well, let's get a plate of those then. 
  I think I might have a dahl. 
  it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice. 
  ok. How about some lamb kebabs? 
  I think I'll have a beer. 
  I wouldn't recommend it. I think we should wait until she comes round. 
  what would you do without me?
  Yes, I did, but Linda stood me up. She didn't keep the date for the first time. 
  I don't know. 
  I did phone her this morning, but she hung up on me. I think she is going to walk out on me. 
  I will. Thanks for your advice.
  Which one will you be going to? 
  Sure, I've been meaning to visit that place myself. 
  OK, can I bring a date with me? 
  Yes. that is a very good idea. It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit. 
  I'll be there. Oh, is there a cover charge at the bar? 
  I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I. 
  One last question. Is there a dress code there? 
  Perfect. I wanted to have a casual evening tonight. 
  Okay. See you then.
  I would like to rent a car. What kind of car do you have? 
  What is the rate? 
  How about mileage and gas? 
  OK. I'll try a Pinto. I want to rent a car for one week. 
  Here you are.
  What do you mean? 
  I think the Romans do what everyone else does. 
  And Roman really loves life. He knows how to enjoy himself. 
  Really? 
  By air of course.
  You're screwed. You can't do anything about that. You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful. 
  No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way. 
  Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss. 
  Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology. 
  I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full. 
  I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class. 
  No problem, man.
  well, last night I had a big argument with Ann. 
  now that I look back at it, it wasn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper. 
  it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, and we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, said her boyfriend had made plans and that she leaves. 
  I know, but I was so upset. I mean, come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says? 
  well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often. 
  yeah, I'll call her later to patch things up.
  What size pan were you thinking of? 
  Well, this one might work for you. 
  Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size. 
  Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle. 
  I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay? 
  Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan.
  Hello, Lucy, this is Monica. I'm calling for the accountant position. I saw the information about the vacancy on your company's website. Is it still available? 
  No, not yet. First, I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information. 
  The notification period of my current job is not that long and I'm quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I'm good dealing with the people from other cultures. It makes the whole job even more interesting. I will send my resume to you still this week.
  Send an ambulance fast! My husband is having a heart attack! 
  I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield. Oh, hurry, I don't know what to do! 
  yes, yes, he's right here by me. 
  Yes, he's breathing, but he's not conscious! Oh, please hurry!
  I'm so happy about that. 
  I sure did. How about you? 
  I have complete confidence in our new President. 
  I know he will help change America. 
  I feel like things are already changing, because he was elected. 
  I'm not worried about our country now that it's in his hands.
  Are you working fewer hours than you used to work? 
  You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours. 
  Most jobs provide unemployment, but some don't. 
  You can call your unemployment office, and they can check for you. 
  There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned. They will let you know when you file your claim.
  Thank you very much for offering me this opportunity. 
  I have enjoyed talking with you too. Thank you. 
  Yes, please. My telephone number is 367 - 1314. You can call me between four and six in the afternoon. 
  Thank you for your interview.
  Good afternoon. Can I help you? 
  Certainly. 
  Two yuan, please. 
  Wait a moment. It seems that your letter is overweight. Let me weight it. 
  I'm afraid it is. So you will have to pay two yuan extra. The total charge is four yuan. 
  Here are the stamps and your receipt. 
  You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered. It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive. 
  Not at all.
  I don't think we can. 
  By the middle of October, I think. 
  I understand. 
  But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter. In fact, many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter. 
  I see your point. However, we have done more business this year than any of the previous years. I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery. 
  You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you. But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands. 
  All right. We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say.
  Yes, I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it. 
  If you like the outside, you are going to really love the inside. 
  You'll notice that the window treatments, carpeting, and drapes are all new. 
  Follow me into the kitchen. You will love it. 
  The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom. 
  Let's take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home.
  I listen to various types of music. 
  I enjoy listening to both Rock and R & B. 
  I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use. 
  That's exactly what I think too.
  I'm no doctor, but it's not black and blue or anything. Maybe you just need to rest it for a few days.
  People here are more serious than that in Spain. Spanish people are lazy but fun to be with. Also, before I came to England, people told me that the English are very polite. It is known internationally. But I don't think it is true. Using words like please, thank you, sorry, and excuse me is one thing, but real politeness is more than that, I think.
  Good morning, sir. I'd like to talk with you about my studies for a minute, if I may. 
  Thank you. I have a record of my studies for last year. Would you like to see it? 
  Yes, I am. But I'd like to apply for admission to the engineering college next year. 
  Yes, I have. They think it is a good idea. 
  I hope not. Anyway, I am going to apply. And I'd like to ask you to write a recommendation for me, if it is not too much trouble. 
  No, sir. I think that is all. Thank you very much. 
  Thank you, Good-bye.
  Yes. I dare say it will be.  
  No. I don't think that's possible. Some places are sure to be open.  
  Mmm, you may be right.  
  No. We couldn't possibly.  
  It will be summer. So it will be hot.  
  Yes. It could happen. 
  It's nice to go home earlier once in a while. But it's the evening rush.  
  Sure it is. I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam. 
  Thanks, Sarah. And good evening, sports fans. It was an exciting day in world soccer. Mexico defeated France 7 to 6 in the close game that offered spectators plenty of excitement. The game between Canada and Argentina ended in a tie, 3 to 3. And in a game that still in progress, Italy is leading Haiti 2 to 1, with 30 minutes left to go.
  No, not at all. 
  Well, our plane didn't take off on time. It was delayed 5 hours. So we didn't get to Lhasa until 4:00 in the morning, and we were very tired when we got there. But we managed to book a car at the airport through a car rental platform. And it dropped us off at the hotel in time around 7:00 o'clock for breakfast, so that was alright. 
  Well, we were a little disappointed with the room, but the Patella Palace was just a stone thrown away. 
  Oh, we always look forward to going on a holiday. We always make sure we can get away at least once a year.
  Sure. I was climbing the mountain in Nuremberg. Suddenly, the weather became really bad. There was lots of snow and we couldn't see anything. We got lossed. Well, we spent 4 days on the mountain. The temperature was 20 degrees below 0. We didn't have any equipment or food. 
  Yes. But we were very sick. I couldn't move my legs because of the cold. I spent 2 months in the hospital. The doctors removed my legs. 
  That's right. In fact, I decided to make some new legs for myself. I realized that no one has to be physically disabled. We can use modern technology to help. 
  Yes, I can. In fact, these are better than climbing shoes. The spring design means they're much more powerful.
  I ' d rather you didn ' t, Miss Yang. I ' m very busy now. 
  Yes, of course. 
  Well, uh... I ' m still pretty busy, but... all right. Come in. What can I do for you? 
  Not at all. Take a seat. Now what can I do for you? 
  Yes. But why should you want to do that? 
  Not at all. Go ahead. 
  Yes. I ' d be delighted if you did.
  That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please? 
  Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Michelle. What days do you need that reservation, sir? 
  Our room rates recently went up. Is that okay with you, Mr. Sandals? 
  Each night will be $ 308. 
  Wonderful! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room? 
  Next question, Is a queen-size bed okay? 
  Okay, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is in our computer. All we need now is a phone number. 
  Thank you, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to seeing you in New York!
  That's great to hear. 
  For each month you would have to pay $ 1050. 
  I don't think that is too much for rent. 
  That's not enough. 
  $ 850 a month is not enough money. 
  That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
  It just isn't on time today. 
  I think it'll be here pretty soon. 
  I really do hate public transportation. 
  That's right. 
  Oh, that's the worst. 
  I completely agree with that.
  Yeah, about. 
  Oh, definitely. I remember, when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone. 
  I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation. 
  I am not exaggerating at all. I'm telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time. 
  Yes, absolutely true.
  Come on, you think about what to wear almost every day. There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe. 
  I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you. 
  No kidding! Again? ! You just went shopping yesterday. You really are a shopaholic. 
  OK. Do you have the receipt with you? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first.
  Hi, Ms. Seymour? It's Allan Parker. I'Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week. 
  Well, I want to let your boss know that she'd better hold on to you! You're a hard worker!
  First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that? 
  Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it? 
  Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money? 
  Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today? 
  I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1 
  I'll see you later then. Have a great day!
  I wouldn't do it if I were you. 
  It's very dangerous, you know. 
  It's an easy way to get hurt, let me tell you. 
  Well, take care of yourself, and don't say I didn't warn you.
  You are in the right place. Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat. 
  Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is. 
  Usually if your white count is off, the doctor suspects an infection. 
  It is only a pin prick. I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find. 
  That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed. Thanks for coming in!
  Let me see. Oh, we have the design but not the same color as this one. 
  You're welcome.
  What did you have in mind? 
  I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap. 
  I want to give a gift that is really meaningful. 
  Or what only we are able to give them.
  I'm splendid. How about yourself? 
  So, have you been on the bus very long? 
  How often do you ride the bus? 
  You have your own vehicle? 
  So then, why don't you drive it? 
  Smart.
  Yes, of course. What is it? 
  Okay, what should I do? 
  Yes, of course. I have to go there every Tuesday. 
  What's the presentation about? 
  Will you need anything special for the presentation? 
  I suppose you need the whiteboard set up.
  Indeed. I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan. That is, if my credit rating is satisfactory. 
  I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations. You know, a bit of decorating, some new furniture, nothing flashy. 
  It says here that the maximum is 20, 000 RMB. Is that flexible? 
  Well, 20, 000 RMB, it'll have to be then. 
  Everything is right here. If that's all in order, just let me know where I sign.
  Oh, to tell you the truth, I love the sky. When I was a child, I imagined flying into the blue sky some day. Now, I think the day has come. My dream will come true. And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people. 
  Yes, I think I am quite fluent in English. I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month. 
  The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight. And good service is also important. 
  I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition. 
  Yes, I have two years of nursing experience, and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital. 
  My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters. I've never had any vision problems. 
  One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality. But sometimes, I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing. 
  I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures.
  I am very active and energetic. I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done. 
  I am quite outgoing, I think. I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people. 
  I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends. A person can't live all by himself. A friend in need is a friend indeed. So the more really close friends I have, the happier I am. 
  Yes, I would call three of my former classmates really close friends. We often get together and talk with each other. Whenever I counter difficulties, they are always ready to give me a hand. 
  People who are honest, dedicated to their work and have integrity. 
  Slacker and those who violate working principles.
  I want the one with a bed. 
  175 a night?! That's highway robbery! 
  I don't really care which type of room we get as long as we don't end up with a room on the ground floor. I don't like having people walking back and forth outside my window all night. 
  No, not really. 
  What?! For that price, I'd better get a view of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!
  Hello! I'd like to book a flight to Berlin for the 23rd this month. 
  Er, well, I'd like to catch a return flight on the 29th. Oh, and I'd like the cheapest seat possible. 
  I see. How much is it for one day earlier? 
  All right. Then I'll take that flight. 
  All right. Thanks.
  Quite a lot. I mean I'm allowed out most evenings. Weekdays, I have to be back by 9:30. But on weekends I can stay out till 11:00. 
  Yes, my parents give me two pounds a week. 
  Yes, I want to go on holidays this coming summer with my boyfriend, but they say I have to wait till I am 17. 
  I don't know...he is very responsible, my boyfriend, even my parents think so and I don't see how a year or two is going to make much difference.
  Well, ... yeah. I'm looking for a Father's Day gift. 
  Hmm. How much is that wallet? 
  The black one. 
  Huh? That's too expensive for me. Do you have a cheaper one? 
  Umm... I don't think my father will like the design on the outside, and it doesn't have a place to put pictures. How much is it anyway? 
  Humm. I don't have that much money. 
  I'm not sure [money falling on the table]. Probably about ten dollars or so. I've been helping my mom around the house for the past week to earn some money. This is all I have. 
  That's real pretty, but the price tag says $13.99, and I know I don't have that much money. 
  Oh, thanks. I'll take it.
  Where are you heading now?  
  Is that the university next to the Teachers' College?  
  You mean we'll share the taxi?  
  Well. Don't worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you. 
  May I take your size?  
  No problem.  
  About a week.  
  20 yuan for a skirt. 
  Well, you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job, either.  
  Yeah, and every high school student in town is banging on your door, right?  
  You're such a dreamer! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass? 
  Yes, I am studying in Eastern Asian language department.  
  I major in Japanese.  
  Its very helpful. The course has let me into a world of literature. I read so many great literatures. 
  You are in the right place. Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat.  
  Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is.  
  Usually if your white count is off, the doctor suspects an infection.  
  It is only a pin prick. I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find.  
  That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed. Thanks for coming in! 
  That's right. 
  I was born in Montreal and I lived there for 4 years. The first 4 years, but uh, I grew up in Calgary in Alberta. 
  When I was young. I was into books. I was a big reader. I used to go to the library with my mother. 
  The first big trip I took abroad was when I was 14. I went to Liverpool that time. Where my mother is from and Wales and Scotland on the 5 or 6 trips after that.
  I'm fine, mom. It's just your cellphone. You lent it to me this morning. 
  No, I was texting Jack outside a store and somebody ran past and grabbed it. 
  I am afraid so. Everything just happened so suddenly. I was too shocked. 
  No. It was someone in a white shirt. But there's a camera on the entrance. It might have got a shot of the thief's face. 
  Well, not yet. But I will tomorrow. 
  OK, I will.
  You really should go to Rachel's pet store. 
  it's more than special. You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more. 
  snakes? there are even rodents and monkeys! it's a world of exotic pets. 
  Hang on. are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet? 
  but it will pose a risk to your health. 
  i mean, most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria. they are likely to cause immune system problems. 
  I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets, especially for families with young children. 
  yes, good luck, Maria.
  Let me see, about five years, we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003. 
  I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners. They have always followed the contract strictly. We can do business directly with the corporation. As I mentioned before, the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law. Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies. 
  Actually not at present. But we are afraid it will. You know policies influence business to some extent. I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists. China is really a large market. We don't want to lose it. 
  You're welcome.
  Why? 
  OK. You can change it. 
  No, I think it is very boring. Can you change it to Channel Twelve, please? 
  Yeah, it's very funny. Have you ever watched it before? 
  I'm sure you will like it.
  Certainly, sir. 
  I'm sorry, sir. What seems to be the trouble? 
  I'll just go and check it for you, sir.
  Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment? 
  Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering? 
  Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food? 
  That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music? 
  That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday.
  Your prescription will be ready in twenty minutes. 
  Yes, in fact, you can renew this prescription over the Internet and have it delivered to your home. 
  You should take it twice a day. 
  You need something in your stomach when you take it. Don't drink alcohol with this medication. 
  Sometimes you might feel dizzy, but that isn't common.
  No more today, honey. 
  Yes, honey. Go to your room, and take out your book. It's your reading time now. 
  Just go to read. I will find it, honey.
  I stopped you for driving through a red light. 
  You didn't know? 
  Don't you know that yellow means slow down? 
  Why'd you speed up instead? 
  I'll have to write you a ticket. 
  Here's your ticket.
  Nope. I guess something might have come up. 
  I don't know. I hope it's nothing serious. 
  Oh? What happened? 
  Is she fine now? 
  Oh, poor Alan! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year.
  sure. 
  well, you are a very hard-worker. 
  there are trying times for everyone. What do you propose? 
  that's quite a bit. If I give you a raise, I'm going to have to give everyone a raise. 
  that sounds reasonable. How about this, from now on, you can be responsible for scheduling. That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift, then you'll have to do it. 
  of course. It's be against the law if we didn't. 
  you are welcome. Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling.
  That movie's just a lot of noise, same as Simon. 
  I had to go by myself, he couldn't make it. 
  Kitty's? He sure gets around, doesn't he? 
  His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again. 
  I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy. 
  Well, I think it's the time to pull the plug. 
  Thanks anyway, but I'll do it, Rebecca. Let's get the class.
  Yes? 
  Why not? 
  I'm sorry. I can't. What does the note say. 
  Sorry, I'm very near sighted.
  sure. Where do you want to go? Are you in the mood for anything in particular? 
  dumplings again? ! Oh, Amy, let's try something new! 
  how about the Mongolian hot pot? 
  maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base. 
  yes. The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines. 
  wait a minute. Let me throw on a sweater.
  You should be optimistic about this. Things have taken a good turn. You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible. 
  It's once in blue moon. 
  The main one is radiation. There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space. The first is radiation from the sun, and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface. The second, less harmful, comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts.
  Yes, I want an eye-shadow. 
  Purple. But today, I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour. 
  May I have a try? 
  It's still too dark. Any brighter colours? 
  What about other brands? 
  Oh, that's the very thing I need.
  Thanks. Actually, I was really surprised. I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there. 
  Thanks a lot. I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too. You'Ve been doing some great work.
  Which credit card are you speaking of? 
  We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago. 
  Your bill was mailed already. 
  If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office. 
  If that's the case, you will need to provide proof of their mistake. 
  Don't mention it. Call back if you have any more questions.
  Please wait till your name is called. OK. Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine. It comes to one hundred yuan. 
  Good. Here is the receipt. The dispensary is over there. . . By the way, will this be covered by your insurance from work? 
  In that case, I'll give you a certificate, so you can get it reimbursed. 
  Don't lose this receipt, because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork.
  Where did you see it? 
  You found an apartment in the ads? 
  Tell me about the apartment. 
  How much is the rent for the apartment? 
  That's pretty cheap for out here. 
  Congratulations on the new apartment.
  Yes. I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun. 
  I guess I'll send it by airmail. 
  No, there are only some vases. 
  Have you got boxes for sale? 
  Is it all right this time? 
  OK. 
  Yes, I have.
  How can I miss it! But with the bus drivers on strike and taxis so expensive, we have no choice but to take the subway. If only we had a car.
  Just a mistake? Do you realize that I've invited some very important people to dinner? It could cause me to lose an important business partner. 
  I can't get in touch with them now. They are probably on their way at this very minute. Surely you could fit one more table in. 
  Well, that's better than nothing.
  Dr. Cardano, I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my right foot. 
  No. It just started hurting all of a sudden. 
  I suppose it's more like the first one. But it's definitely difficult to walk, so it's not really going away, either. 
  Do you want me to take off both socks? 
  What does it mean, doctor? 
  OK. I need to use the restroom first. Can you tell me where that is? 
  Thanks.
  Okay. Do you have a particular size in mind?  
  Look at this one. It's our biggest pan.  
  Okay, we have the same thing in aluminum.  
  Try this one. Same aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle.  
  That's a good choice. How do you want to pay for it?  
  I'm so sorry. A lid comes with the pan. Here it is. 
  Johnson? I can't place them.  
  They've completely slipped my mind.  
  No, I don't recall a thing about them.  
  Hmm, I must be getting absent-minded. 
  Yes, unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog. Would you please keep my reservation?  
  Lincoln. That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N. Thank you. 
  I know, I'm coming. 
  But I can't find my wallet. 
  I'm sorry. I didn't hear my alarm. It's not like I did it on purpose. It's not my fault. 
  Damn it. I can't find it. Do you see my wallet anywhere? It's made of brown leather. 
  Of course I did. I'm not that dumb. Oh, wait a second. Oh, here it is. 
  Yeah, yeah. Say why don't we take the express train to the airport? It will be faster than a taxi. 
  OK, OK. 
  I can't find my keys.
  Reservation desk. May I help you? 
  Alright, sir. That's a single room with a bath? 
  Our singles began at 45 per night, sir. 
  Your name, please. 
  Thank you, Mr. Chan. When will you be arriving? 
  Right, sir. We'll hold your room for you until 9:00 PM.
  Speaking. 
  Sure. Well it was 2 days ago on November the tenth about 11:00 PM. I decided to fry some chips so I used quite a lot of oil. I was deep frying. Uhm the oil finally got hot enough, so I put the chips in and then my mom rang. 
  We started talking and I completely forgot about the chips. After the call. I just went back to my living room. 
  Yes, I watch TV for about 20 minutes and the next thing I knew there was the smell of smoke in someone was shouting fire fire. I immediately realized it was my chips. I rushed out of the room. The kitchen was next door. Well, there were flames all over one wall. 
  Well, I grabbed some blankets from my bed and ran to the kitchen to throw them over the flames. By that time, my neighbors had already called the fire Department. The firefighters arrived, I think within about 10 minutes and put the fire out very quickly. 
  Well. I'll have to replace the cooker completely. Besides, I have to have 2 kitchen units and one wall repaired.
  Good morning, sir. I'm calling to cancel a reservation. 
  They are January twenty nineth through February 1. 
  No, sir. I've started a new job recently so I won't have anytime off for at least 6 months. 
  Yes, thank you, sir.
  I've worked as a music teacher my whole life, mainly with children. And now I'm ready for a change, because I love music so much. I think working at a radio station would be perfect for me. 
  I'm experienced in sending emails and I'm also fairly confident on the phone. When I was a teenager, I worked at a TV station answering phone calls. So this is probably pretty similar. 
  I'm an early riser, so that's easy for me. It also means less traffic, which I'm always a fan of. 
  Yes, I have a list to give you. Two are people I worked with at my last job, and one is an old graduate school professor of mine. 
  Thank you so much.
  I think I'd rather get a dog. Dogs are more faithful than cats. 
  We'd have to invest a lot of money in a cage or a fish tank, and I don't really know how to take care of a bird or a fish. 
  Yeah, you're right. Let's go grab some coffee and talk about it.
  Not yet. They say they are still working on it. 
  Sorry, I totaly forgot. I will do it tomorrow. 
  Is there anything good on at the cinema tonight? 
  John Wayne again? No. What else? 
  No. Not really. 
  You know, I'd like to see a film that will cheer me up and help me relax. I don't want to see something frightened. 
  That sounds like it could be funny. When and where is it on? 
  Just 30 minutes from now. Come on. Let's hurry.
  Well, I didn't watch TV much, so it wasn't that. I had an uncle Who was a film actor, but I hardly saw him. One day I wandered into a library and picked up the biography of a famous cameraman. I loved it and knew then what I wanted to do. 
  Just one actually. It wasn't like winning a prize for a popular movie or for a special TV advertisement. It was a video for a school program about the development of the cinema. 
  Well, I'm less interested in working with famous film stars than with students and film academy actually. They got skills that the ordinary person with no training doesn't have but they haven't been affected by success. 
  Well, doing interesting work you see the world but your job is and always in wonderful places and you have lots of chances to get to know some interesting actors and directors. That has to be the best bit from my point of view.
  That's what I am going to do. 
  I surely will. How much is this wood carving? 
  That's OK. Is anything else recommended? 
  I'd like to see some traditional arts. 
  Yes, I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends. 
  Sounds good. I'll take paper-cut. 
  You collect them yourself? I think that you are just doing the wholesale. 
  Wow, you are the expert on it.
  That ' s a big order, Jane. I am really swamped. 
  Right. Okay, let me see what I can do. How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting? It won ' t take more than a half hour, will it?
  I need to buy a new refrigerator today. 
  I like that Kenmore refrigerator. 
  Tell me about it. 
  What are the appliances. 
  I'd like to see it for myself. 
  I like what I see.
  Yes, ma'am. How may I help you? 
  Yes, we do deliveries for orders over $ 15, ma'am.
  I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice. 
  Well. During the college years, I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices. Does that count? 
  I did clerical stuff and ran errands. 
  May I know about the office hours? 
  Er, may I know how much I will be paid monthly? 
  When will I know your decision? 
  Yes, I did. Can you call after 7 p. m. ? I'm usually out in the daytime. 
  Good-bye.
  When I was in LA, I met the WebTracker sales rep. 
  The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours. He said everybody at WebTracker used them. 
  We both may be snakes, Dave, but I'm just better at it. Among the snakes, I'm the sneakiest.
  Oh yeah, that sounds pretty cool, I guess. . . 
  Oh really. . . well you must be very popular on the Internet. But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home.
  no. please sit down. 
  are you also going to Beijing? 
  I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before? 
  really? What did you think? 
  was it that crowded? 
  oh, maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car. 
  thank you very much!
  Yeah, I've been working so much overtime lately. 
  My boss gave me a big project. I had to have it finished by this morning. It was so difficult. 
  I know, but hard work pays off. You know. 
  Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for.
  I am a girl of many interests. I like dance, chess, collecting stamps, travelling and taking photos. 
  I like rumba and tango. 
  You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess. Both of them are much easier. 
  Yes, it is. But it is full of fun and knowledge. What about you, what do you like to do as hobby? 
  Sounds pleasant.
  Well. . . this one costs more, but it has a much better sound. This part of it is made of wood, not plastic. And there's a tone control, too. 
  Hmm. . . well, the other one is good for the money. It's much cheaper. We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them. 
  Certainly.
  Yes, we can also see some yew trees. 
  Listen to the sound of nature! It's like music. 
  What are those. Miss Liu? 
  The red and yellow peony flowers are so beautiful. 
  Sure. I'm going to take more pictures today. 
  You are so kind. Thanks.
  You are welcome. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me. 
  Yes, please. My telephone number is 2974-5328, and you can call me at any time in the daytime. 
  Great. I will look forward to hearing from you. And do I need the second interview? 
  Goodbye.
  How should I get their contact info. 
  Where should I put them up? 
  The clients like the Shangri-La Hotel more. 
  What else would I prepare, Sir? 
  Certainly. 
  Of course. I'm on it
  You did a fabulous job. 
  That's what I'm telling you. 
  You did mess up a little on one thing. 
  You had a little trouble on your parallel parking. 
  That's something that you really need to work on. 
  You're still going to get it.
  We offer a reduction of 50 % and comes to $ 10. 
  Well, here you are. 
  Of course.
  I think you'd better take the No. 16 bus. It can take you right there. 
  Every fifteen minutes. 
  The No. 2 bus also goes to the railway station. You may take it. 
  The bus stop is not far from here. Go straight on and you can easily find it. 
  You are welcome.
  I think so ; hurry up and get off. 
  I don't know. 
  I think I was wrong. 
  I don't know ; it kind of looks like we did. 
  I'm sorry. I thought this was our stop. 
  We could always wait for the next bus to come.
  Let me see, I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours. 
  What would a typical day be like for me here? 
  Oh, yes, I do. My present job is similar in that respect, and I think I'm doing a good job.
  You have to make an appointment before we can come out and install it. 
  What day are you available? 
  Three o'clock is the only time we can come in. 
  I'm sorry, but that's our only available time. 
  We're completely open on Saturday. 
  That'll be fine.
  My fault. I didn't realize what time it was. 
  Not really. I'm telling the truth. 
  This is true, but it must've slipped my mind. 
  I know. I should've called. 
  You want to throw me out over this? 
  That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.
  Don't be so dramatic. You're such a baby. Now sit down and finish your soup. 
  And when we get back from the doctor's, you'll gargle again. 
  Well, the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen, and their soup isn't as tasty as mine!
  You and I must have the same idea. The only way to beat the crowds when you do the grocery shopping on Saturday is to be here when they open at 9:00 o'clock sharp!
  No. I got divorced years ago. Even worse, I got divorced when I had small children. 
  Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children. 
  We tell them we love them and will always do. 
  Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer. 
  It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing. 
  I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarreling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children. 
  Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future.
  Yes, I'm coming tonight. I didn't come last week because my guitar was broken. 
  Thanks, but I can only play music on my guitar because it's a left-handed guitar...it's for people who use their left hands for most things. I fixed my guitar on Monday night. 
  I've been so busy this month! I have to work at the grocery store and watch my little sister until my mom comes home from work.
  Can you tell me where your wine list is?  
  Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant?  
  Do you have any house specials that you could recommend?  
  That sounds like a good choice for me. May I have one, please?  
  Please bring it to me on the rocks.  
  I would like it with no salt, please. 
  How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read?  
  Does he even know how to speak English?  
  That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me.  
  Oh, all right. Have him come over here for dinner. But you get to make dinner! 
  No problem. Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on, with the opening in the back.  
  You will stand over here up against this plate.  
  You will raise your arms up shoulder high.  
  Yes, you are doing great.  
  I need to stand behind this shield. Now you will take a deep breath, hold it, and let it out.  
  That's it. You can get dressed when the film is developed. 
  Come on. I'm sure it's not that bad. Can I come in and take a look, honey? 
  I thought you like the styles from the eighties. 
  I never knew that you could divide it up like that. I just thought all eighties styles were good. 
  It's all up to you.
  Yes, my family went swimming with Mr. Henry and his son last Saturday. When we got there, my wife and I started looking for a nice spot near the pool. My son ran off by himself and went over to the pool. The next thing we knew, he was in the water. 
  No, he can't. We told him to stay in the shallow part of the pool, but he slipped into the deep part of the pool by accident. 
  Yes, lucklily Henry was nearby and immediately realized that he was drowning. Henry has taken some swimming lessons. So he knew right away that my son was in danger. 
  Yes, we were so frightened. We'd originally planned to swim there for an hour, but after that, we left in a hurry.
  Much better, thanks. She'll be back home in a few days. 
  I think I'll need a week to take care of her and do some cleaning. 
  I prefer to do it myself. 
  I'm just a regular son.
  Gina you should go to Jimmy's garage. I take my car there all the time. They have 20 years of experience and they are especially good at repairing older cars. 
  Well, you should call and make an appointment now. They do a good job. They are usually not busy after 6:00 o'clock.
  Pretty good. How are you doing? 
  I'm sorry to hear that. 
  They're very nervous about the final. 
  I'm so glad to hear that.
  Hmm...I got up at 11:30 AM. I'm having brunch now. 
  2:00 AM. 
  I played computer games. I have been so absorbed in it that I forgot the time. I'm always crazy about playing the game. It's a pain in the neck to cut down playing the game. 
  Hmm...Good idea. I'll try it from tomorrow. Thank you very much. Really nice speaking to you. 
  See you.
  From Vancouver, we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg. 
  Relatively, once we're out of Alberta, anyway. Then it's hills again in Aitoba. 
  That's right. And up in to Quebec. And that's where we stop. 
  Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime?
  You've been sneezing a lot lately. Are you sick or something? 
  I never have seasonal allergies. 
  What are all the symptoms? 
  That doesn't sound good. 
  Well, I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol. It runs in the family. 
  I get it pretty bad. My whole face turns red, including my ears. My eyes become bloodshot, and I start to itch all over my body. 
  But that doesn't stop me from drinking. Ahahah.
  All right. Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here. 
  The train is coming. There are a lot of people waiting here. let's stand in a better position to get on the train 
  No, but it will be soon. Look, there're two empty seats over there. Let's get them.
  I think there ' s a Western on. 
  Well, I really wanted to see the football game. 
  I believe there ' s a sitcom. 
  Let me look in the TV Guide first. 
  If I remember correctly, it's a quiz show. 
  Let's watch it together.
  I'm happy to hear you say that. 
  I'm renting this apartment out for $ 1050 a month. 
  That is a fair price. 
  That's no good. 
  I won't go any lower than $ 1050. 
  That's the best I can do.
  it's Beethoven. Do you like it? 
  I don't know about that, but I do think that it helps people relax. 
  actually, I mostly just listen classical music. What about you? 
  what kind of music do you prefer then? 
  not really. I don't think pop music has much depth. 
  how long have you been in to pop music, then? 
  not really. When I was little, we didn't really listen to music at all. 
  well, when I was about 10 years old, I started playing the piano. I think that's how it all started. 
  yes, it's one of my hobbies.
  I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife. 
  I think something in the countryside would be nice. 
  Sounds good! What is the hotel that we will be staying at like? 
  Wow! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in? 
  I'm sold! I want to book this trip. I don't care what it costs! Money is no object!
  Give me a little while longer. 
  There you go. How do you like it? 
  You think it looks nice? 
  Thanks. I'm glad that I did a good job. 
  Just give me $ 55. 
  No problem, girl friend. I'll see you next time.
  Yes, I am studying in Eastern Asian language department. 
  I major in Japanese. 
  It's very helpful. The course has let me into a new world of literature. I read so many great literatures.
  I'm not sure. I guess I'll just stay at home. Maybe I'll catch up on my reading. What about you? Any plans? 
  Sounds great! 
  Do you mean it? I'd love to!
  Thank you. 
  Sure! Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose this course of study for two reasons. I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track provided, and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in psychology. 
  Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master's in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service. 
  Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care, and process management. I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction. 
  Yes, in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company. With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five percent, which had a direct impact on revenue.
  Oh, I thought I could make a right turn on red here. 
  Oh, I guess I didn't see it. 
  Here they are. 
  Thank you, Ma'am.
  But where do I get a ticket? 
  Oh, I wish I didn't have so much to carry.
  What are you going to look for? 
  What store are you going to? 
  You don't know? 
  Would you like me to tell you where I got mine. 
  I went to get mine from IKEA. 
  They're not cheap, but neither is their furniture.
  It's your blood pressure, I'm afraid. It's far too high. 
  Overwork-amongst other things. You can't work 24 hours a day. You'Ve got to slow down. 
  You've got to, I'm afraid. And look at this. You weigh 200 stones. That's too much for a man of your size. 
  Yes. You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise.
  Yes, it's a one-bedroom apartment, with a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom and a balcony. 
  It's on Montreal Road. 
  Yes, it is furnished with sofas, a dining table, chairs and some appliances. 
  It's five hundred dollars per month, including utilities. 
  Yes, that's right. 
  The management fee is included in the rent. But parking is fifty dollars a month. 
  Yes, how about one o'clock this afternoon? 
  See you.
  Rod, it's lovely to see you again. 
  Fine but tiring. Milan was interesting, it's bigger than I expected, noisier and dirtier, too. 
  Well, I didn't go there. Have you been there? 
  Yes, but the suitcase is very heavy. 
  Just 20 pairs of shoes.
  yes, I graguated with a BA in English from Qingdao Uinversity.  
  just a few years ago. What about you?  
  are you planning on going to university?  
  have you applied anywhere yet?  
  congratulations! Which one is the cheapest?  
  which one has the most interesting course?  
  where would you like to be located?  
  have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort?  
  I think you should do that soon. It will help you make a decision about the school you go to.  
  good luck! 
  Yes, it is. Thanks. I'm just surfing on the internet.  
  This cafe offers a wireless internet connection. That means I can get on the net for free while I'm here. Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee!  
  No. you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city.  
  I've got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs.  
  It's wonderful, isn't it? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently? 
  There are a few stories about natural disasters. There is a massive forest fire in Australia. It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers.  
  Nobody knows at the moment, but it has been very hot there recently. The drought in Africa is causing starvation. Millions of people have migrated to try and find food.  
  The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies. Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies. Refugee camps have been set up across the region.  
  Six have been seriously affected, but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries.  
  Yes. There have been a few there recently. They say that this one was not a big quake. The Iranians are dealing with it on their own. They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble.  
  So far, less than 20 people have died, but over 100 are in hospital. 
  You can buy an app that will stop those ads. 
  It's not that expensive. It's $1 per month. 
  Is it going to take you a whole year to finish that essay? 
  I think it's worth it, John. And if you spend $30, you don't have to pay the monthly cost. 
  No, you pay once and you can use it forever.
  It's called Tie Guanyin, and is a kind of Wulong tea. 
  It's confusing and there is no agreement on it. Generally speaking, there are 4 kinds of tea based on processing methods. They're green tea, black tea, Wulong tea and scented tea. 
  Yes, it is. But there are also considerations of time and personal health. For example, green tea is good in summer. It seems to drive away the heat and bring a feeling of relaxation. However, pregnant women should not drink it. 
  Sure, I'll be glad to.
  It's a quarter after 7. We're on time. Don't panic. 
  Sure, we will. Rush hour is almost over. Anyway, the party starts at 30 minutes later, but I do need help with directions. Can you call the restaurant and ask them where we park our car?
  Where would you keep them? 
  It's a bit small, isn't it? 
  I think you should get a tank if you want to keep fish. 
  Yes, you should never keep fish in a small round bottle. They don't get enough air. I suggest we go shopping together and look for a nice tank. 
  Check the prices before you buy one and you ought to put a few large rocks in the tank. Fish love swimming around the rocks and through holes in them. 
  Yes, you need to get some underwater plants, for one thing they keep the water clean, also they make the tank look much prettier.
  Oh, hi. Sorry, but you are? 
  Oh, Peter, how are you? 
  You mean like now? I have swimming practice in a few minutes. And then I have to study for a biology exam. I could meet you right after dinner. 
  The what? 
  Oh, sorry. I just got transferred here a month ago. 
  OK. See you around then.
  I think I'll just stay at home. I may see some friends and watch a few DVDs and I probably would go to the auto a car show. What about you Alexia? What's your plan? 
  Oh? Where to? 
  That's exciting. How long do you plan to stay? 
  Thank you. You too.
  I'd like to withdraw some money from my account. 
  Well, actually, it's quite a substantial amount. Here's my Bank Book. Will that cause a problem? 
  Yes, that seems to be all in order. Thanks very much.
  Thank you. So pleasant to meet you here! 
  Yes, I've brought a list of your recent products with me. We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year. We're ready to place an order with you. 
  That sounds good. But I have a proposal now. 
  Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously. Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us? 
  Sounds like we have the same idea.
  Oh, uh. . . Thanks. Henry, do you have a light? 
  Thanks. Lovely day. Pity I'm on duty. 
  Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.
  Yeah. The autumn is marvelous here. 
  That's a hard time. The air is cold and damp, and the road is often icy. 
  Sure. 
  Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area. 
  That's right.
  Where have you been, Alice, you're over an hour late. 
  why ere you getting off work so late? The office close at six, doesn't it? 
  Didn't you tell him you have an appointment? 
  Well. You're here.
  I need to return a book. 
  I want to check this magazine out. 
  Why not? 
  So what am I allowed to check out? 
  I need to check out this magazine. 
  That doesn't make any sense.
  Yes. I'm leaving tomorrow. I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you. 
  I'll miss you too, my friends.
  Actually, I had a perfect plan for this afternoon, but it is totally ruined by the sand storm. I woke up this morning and found it was sunny. So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me. We were going to look for a new purse. Now it turned out to be like this. Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore. 
  What's wrong with climate? Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can't people do something to stop it? 
  My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment.
  Yeah, I've been looking forward to it for ages. 
  They give me a lot of congratulations. 
  Oh, maybe three years. I will study and get the master degree first. Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back. 
  Chicago University. My major is Economics. 
  Thank you!
  You did? that is great! 
  No I am free, I will be there, what time the thing starting? 
  Ok, great, should I bring anything? 
  sure, I will be happy to bring a few, what is the address? 
  Got it.
  Yes. I want to make a remittance to New Delhi. 
  I'd like a banker's draft please. It's not really urgent.
  Please dissolve the powder in hot water. Soak your hand or foot in it for 20 minutes twice a day. 
  Put the eye-drop into your right eye 4 - - 6 times a day, 1 - - 2 drops each time. Squeeze a bit of the ointment on your eyelid every night. 
  You're welcome.
  Yes, I'd like to move to another room. 
  Yes. The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work. 
  Wang Wei. Room 1212. 
  All right. 
  Yes. No problem.
  Only English. 
  I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials. I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator. 
  I have received an oral English training and I can communicate with others fluently. 
  Yes, I did. I got 600 in TOEFL and 2, 300 in GRE. 
  I started to learn English when I was in primary school. 
  The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work. I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm.
  I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days. 
  Well, I would need an idea of how large your order would be. About how many units would you need? 
  Please give me a few minute to calculate. . . Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100. Is that price acceptable to you? 
  Would an order of only 100 units, it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget. Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units, we might be able to work something out.
  Yes, Madam, may I help you? 
  Yes? 
  Oh, yes. Madam, we'll come right away then. Your room number and your name, please? 
  Thank you, would you hang up and wait?
  What size? 
  What colour? 
  I'm sorry. We don't haven any. 
  Did she buy them here? 
  We had some shoes like those a month ago, but we don't have any now. 
  I'm afraid that I can't. They were in fashion last year and the year before last. But they're not in fashion this year. These shoes are in fashion now. 
  They are very uncomfortable. But women always wear uncomfortable shoes!
  Here you are. 
  Yes, I am. 
  Fujisan Province. 
  It's not surprising. Our school year just ended, and a lot of Chinese are on vacation. 
  About half a month. 
  Thank you.
  Yes. How much are these T-shirts? 
  I like the green one, but it isn't big enough. Have you got a larger size? 
  No, it's too dark. I prefer something lighter, yellow or pink. 
  Yes, that's nice. I'll take it. 
  Here you are.
  Yes, I want to buy some shoes to replace the ones I am wearing. 
  They are too old and shabby. 
  Yes. 
  Yes, I'll try them on. 
  The trouble is they feel uncomfortable. 
  They are much better. Do you have them in red'? 
  Yes, if they don't cost too much. 
  Just the red and the old ones. I'll wear the new brown pair home.
  Really? But he always tells me that he usually arrives ten minutes early for the class. This time he is surely to get punished.
  Hi, Susan. Not so well as expected. I've left my position. I can't bear the rudeness of my boss any longer. 
  No idea. Anyway, I've got to think about it seriously. And you? 
  You can't do it for ever. 
  That's a wonderful idea.
  I'm doing great. What about you?  
  Everything's been good with you?  
  I started school recently.  
  I'm going to PCC.  
  I like it so far. My classes are pretty good right now.  
  Thanks a lot. 
  For you, I would recommend this one here.  
  This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving, but also, it has many safety features. I know that as a parent, you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school.  
  This model features anti-lock brakes, airbags on both driver and passenger sides, and impact collision design. But that's not all. This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical.  
  Yes, this price is very affordable, but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption. The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy.  
  Why don't you take it for a test drive, and think it over. 
  Yes,I have. I was employed by the financial section of the university ever since I graduated. I worked there for 3 years. Then I had worked in a bank for 3 years.  
  Very short time. I became an auditor within three months. 
  You have much patience.  
  Thank you. Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet.  
  This is an especially famous one. It says 'May the passing days bring you health and longevity. May this season of renewal find you basked in riches.'  
  No. I never sell my artwork.  
  I give it away. Here, this one is for you.  
  Remember, real luck must be created (by) yourself, and then it cannot be given or taken away. . . 
  It's inenvitable. Their love wasbuilt on the sand, and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks.  
  That give us a good lesson. 
  Two. French and Spanish.  
  Well, French was my best subject at school. I can read and write it pretty well.  
  Well, it's not as good as my French. I can speak it reasonably well, but my written Spanish isn't very good.  
  In that case, I'm fit for the position I think. 
  Excuse me, do you need any help? 
  Uh, well, just press this button of the ticket machine, then, get on the train at platform number four. 
  Usually they come about every 6 minutes. 
  Get off at State Street Station, 3 stops from here. 
  No problem. Good luck.
  Yes, I do. And I've told them to keep the date secrett. John hates that kind of thing. Do you remember when he found out that we bought him a birthday cake last year and that surprised Christmas party? He was angry. But this is different. Getting married is special and we've known him and Anna for years. 
  That'll be fine, thanks.
  Yes, walk down this road and then turn left when you get to the third crossing. You will see it not far ahead of you. 
  Of course. When you turn left, you will see a five-star hotel with a tea shop on the left. The post office is just next to it. It's a three-storey building. 
  About 30 minutes? 
  Uh, well, you can take bus 232 or get a taxi there. 
  You are welcome.
  What places are you going to visit? 
  Oh, you're riding through the Rocky Mountains. That's really exciting. 
  Wow, that's wonderful. You're so lucky! 
  Have a great time and take lots of pictures!
  No. 
  My parents. 
  But they always want me to do what they wish, regardless of my feeling, just because I'm the only child in the family! 
  What is it? Generation gap? 
  That's true, I don't think they understand me. 
  Maybe not much.
  Great, my brother and I went to a lakeside house with my uncle and aunt. 
  My dad volunteered to drive us, fine by me, as I love long car journeys, but he found it tiring. Anyway, I had been wondering how so many of us would fit into the house with a lot of luggage. I need my own quiet place sometimes, so that I can think and read. 
  But it wasn't an issue in the end, as we had comfortable bedrooms to spare. The only real problem was how far we were from the local shop. Getting there turned out to be the job of my brother and me, on bicycles.
  I'd like to book a room. 
  What's the rate for a standard room? 
  I'd like a standard room. 
  December twenty-third, please. 
  Four days. 
  Nancy Brown, my phone number is 7096785634, Nancy Brown. 
  Around 3:00 PM. 
  No, that's it. Thank you very much.
  I like classes, because it's more like the real world than when you're sitting there reading a textbook, not knowing what you're going to be using it for. 
  OK. I'll register for this course today. Can I join now?
  How long will the system be down for? 
  That's fine. We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side.
  It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills. 
  Alright. I'm sorry, Miss. According to our file, this prescription has already been refilled twice. 
  Well, it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription. 
  I'm sorry, Miss. We can't do it. We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out. 
  Miss, I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law. I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription. Never. 
  A prescription must be valid. It cannot be an expired prescription. I'm sorry, Miss. It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you. 
  Miss, I just can't help you on this. I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor. And there are other customers I need to help now. I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry. 
  Maybe that's true. I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too.
  Yes, I'm a very good mother and successful career woman. 
  I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself, like keeping housework simple, spending money on things that make life easier, buying yourself things you like, and so on. You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself. 
  Yes. He is very understanding and supportive.
  I have four years study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation. Moreover, I have worked at CAB Company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience. 
  I am a senior mechanical design engineer. 
  Yes. Here it is. 
  Of course, I designed a more powerful gasoline engine, which greatly increased the speed of limousines.
  Where to, sir? 
  Please hop in. 
  It'll take about 20 minutes. 
  Yes, they are. 
  Yes, it is. Are you in a hurry, sir? 
  Yes, sir.
  Don't you have one like this in blue? 
  Do you need every color in the rainbow? 
  Ze ze ze. . . Women!
  I'd like reading books best. 
  Literature and economy. 
  That's OK. 
  I like to play golf, play badminton or crack jokes. 
  That's a bad habit.
  No. Please sit down. 
  Are you also going to Beijing? 
  I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before? 
  Really? What did you think? 
  Was it that crowded? 
  Oh, maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car. 
  Thank you very much!
  I'm pretty good, you? 
  How long have you been on the bus? 
  Do you catch this bus a lot? 
  So, you have your own car? 
  Then, why are you on the bus with me? 
  That's good thinking.
  What's the specialty of the house? 
  I like fish. Please bring me an order of that. 
  Apple pie, please. 
  Make it two.
  Put it on my VISA. 
  What's wrong with it? 
  You're kidding me! 
  I only have one card. 
  I don't have any cash on me. 
  I'll be back tomorrow.
  What's the difference? 
  You must have bought many things in the mall? 
  It's wise to do it. The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place, so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend. And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful. 
  You must have got many useful things for your new apartment.
  Haven't been sleeping well recently. 
  Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night. I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings. 
  Yeah, I know, but I find these sorts of things hard to say. They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV. Now I just hope the show will end soon. 
  Yeah, I crave my own space. I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time. We all need our private space. But I also think interpersonal skills very important. Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others, otherwise nobody is going to have a good time.
  Yes, I am, and I am so excited. 
  I love my candidate. 
  My candidate is probably the most intelligent. 
  I also agree with all his policies. 
  I know he's going to be the next President. 
  I can't wait to vote.
  Do you think she'd like a laptop? 
  A Mac is something most people appreciate. 
  Our 15 - inch Pro will cost you only $ 2, 100. 
  You've made a good decision. How would you like to pay? 
  It's all yours after you sign here, please. 
  This is good to go. If she wants accessories, just visit us again. 
  Have a nice day, and thank you for shopping here.
  Ordinarily, as soon as you are seated, you put your napkin on your lap. 
  At a formal dinner, you wait for your hostess to put hers on her lap first.
  Yes, it is. There are a lot of stores, office buildings, and theatres near here. 
  That's a department store. It sells clothing, furniture, food-almost everything. 
  There's a men's clothing store next to the bank building on the right. There are also some good stores on Lincoln Street. 
  There's a new play there tonight. The building next to the theatre is a hotel. 
  No, it's just three blocks straight ahead.
  Well, I get better paid and the distance between work and home is shorter. But the best part is that they have training programs to improve our work skills. And they run partly on company time, usually from four to six on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
  It really, is a good thing. And even though the company has to pay for the training, it's worth it in the long run. Because with a greater understanding of the computer programs I use every day, I do my daily tasks more quickly and effectively.
  Oh, Johnny. How are you doing, busy? 
  No. What is it? 
  Wonderful! I'm glad that big ugly things will be gone. 
  I don't see why. 
  Well, I don't know if that huge and boring thing can be our symbol, but I know for sure the city has tens of parks where you can take a nice walk. 
  Does that matter? To me, more importantly, the amusement park means employment. 
  Income. If you have income, you have money to spend, and in turn, it'll create more jobs.
  Yeah, Micky. 
  Uh, I don't know. I thinks it's ... uh ... what time's it? I think it's going on dinner. 
  Three thirty. Uh ... We'd better wait. [Why, Dad?] Well, what kind of snack do you want? 
  No, candy is out. Oh, how about some broccoli? [No!] Uh, carrots? [No!] Well, what else can you suggest? 
  Candy. No, I don't think ... I think You'd better wait. 
  Spinach sandwich? Spinach sandwich! When did you start liking spinach? 
  Well, what about a small sandwich? [Okay] Okay, I'll whip it up in a minute. Play with your toys while you're waiting for it.
  What shall we do in the meantime? 
  Good idea. I am pretty tired.
  Yes. I'm looking for a green dress.  
  I wear size 32. This one looks nice. Where may I try it on?  
  How does it look?  
  How much is it?  
  I'll take it. 
  I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind. But I can't find it.  
  Margaret Mitchell.  
  Thank you very much. I have been looking for it for a long time. Is this the latest edition?  
  How about the price of the hardcover?  
  A little bit expensive, but I will buy one. This is $25 , here you are. 
  Well, last night I had a big argument with Ann.  
  Now that I look back at it, it wasn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper.  
  It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, and we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip. I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all.  
  I know, but I was so upset. I mean, come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?  
  Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.  
  Yeah, I'll call later to patch things up. 
  I think I've caught a cold. Now I'm aching all over.  
  Thank you. I suppose I should go to see a doctor. 
  OK. Are you sure it's funny, though?  
  OK.  
  I see.  
  Oh, that's funny!  
  Oh, sorry.  
  A car door? You mean just one car door?  
  Well... 
  Certainly. What time will you be back? 
  If there is some urgent business, how can I reach you? 
  All right.
  It's taking notes in class. Ever since I hurt my hand, my writing's been slower. And if I push too hard, it gets really painful. 
  That seems simple enough, though I'm not too sure about it. 
  You're really helpful.
  If you want to take a walk, you can go to the garden. It is very relaxing there. 
  No, sir, there is a Recreation Center on the ground floor. You can play table tennis and go bowling. 
  Yes, sir. There is a music teahouse where you can enjoy both classical music and modern music while having some Chinese tea or other drinks. 
  It's a pleasure.
  Turn left at the second light. You can't miss it. 
  No. It's not far at all. 
  That's all right. Have a good day.
  Merry Christmas, Jina. 
  Come have a look, I received many beautiful e-cards. They are from my friends, all over the world. Christmas wishes for all my friends. 
  Sorry, I don't have it. But I do have her Email. You want me to sent it to you? 
  No worries. I just for her card. And you can get her from Email. I would really like to talk to her again. I kind of miss her a little this days. 
  My pleasure.
  Yes, G stands for General Audiences, PG means Parental Guidance suggested, R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content. 
  Remember when we were kids? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent. 
  Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter. 
  Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't.
  What do you want, a single or a double one? 
  How long do you intend to stay? 
  We have one single room on the fifth floor. 
  It's very quiet, sir. 
  It's 150 yuan per day including a 10 % service charge. 
  Would you please fill in the registration form? 
  As a hotel policy, we require one day's room charge as a deposit for guests without reservation. 
  Your room number is 505. This is your key. The bellboy will help you with the baggage.
  Oh, my God! It's my stomach. It's killing me! 
  Right here! It hurts right here! 
  I felt OK when I woke up, and then, suddenly, I had this really sharp pain. 
  No, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary. 
  Thank you for helping me.
  Not really. It's much warmer usually. Your are not used to cold weather? 
  Well, You'd better get some more warm clothes. 
  I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius.
  Yes. Can you show me the menu, please? 
  Then, what's special tonight? 
  All right. We'll have some seafood and vegetables.
  I'm still a student. 
  Boston University. 
  I'm studying English, math, and history. My major is English. 
  More than six years. 
  Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school. 
  Actually, it's not that good. I can read but I can't speak very well. I haven't had a lot of chance to practice. 
  Yes, but I still don't have many friends here yet. 
  Oh thanks for inviting me. I'd love to come.
  Sunday papers. I usually read them after coming back home from our company. 
  As you know, I am a sports fan. And these papers are famous for their sports section. So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in. 
  Correct! What about you, Fred? 
  Don't overdo it. 
  I get drunk easily.
  Yeah. Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior. 
  OK, it's better to be far away from him.
  She will insist. It's a rosary. She has millions of them. Take it. 
  Oh! My grandmother used to say ' raising the pigs, raising the kids '. . . at least you can eat the pigs. ' 
  She likes to complain about her macho husband and her 'bambinos', but she loves them all dearly.
  Yes. What about you? 
  Then your salary must be high. 
  Is this time one of them? 
  Really? We have only one chance every year.
  Yes, it is. Are you looking for housing for this semester? 
  It is, but I can put you on a waiting list, if you would like. 
  Yes, here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As. 
  The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry. You can call them with any questions you may have.
  Who was it? 
  She never cares about others. 
  Her new boyfriend, right? 
  I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing.
  No, the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them. But not too much. As the space between galaxies expands, it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough. 
  Well, the universe is a chaotic place, and the gravity from one galaxy, or from a group of galaxies, may disturb the motion of its near neighbors, causing them to collide. However, on average, when you compare two large enough chunks of space, the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other. 
  You're welcome.
  Look at this one. It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers. 
  Yes, but we shouldn't get any thing too big. Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture. 
  Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration.
  Well, the first year of our marriage, we had great difficulty getting along. The things that are important to me are not important to him. We had a lot of conflicts. 
  And now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart. 
  Right now he speaks mostly Chinese, and he can say a few English words. But he will learn. 
  Yes, people surely can. He's whiter than the Chinese kids, and his hair is a little blonde. My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though.
  What do you do with it? 
  Okay. 
  OK. 
  Hey! 
  Got it.
  I won't ever forget it! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself. . . 
  Oh, it seems like it was just yesterday.
  I had a wonderful time. The rooms are not very big, but they are well furnished. The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced. There's a sauna and a Jacuzzi. 
  No, they don't. they have a beauty parlor, but I didn't go there. 
  It's very good. Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes. The wait staff is very good. A waiter recommended their baked fish, which tasted wonderful. The hotel was quite full, so I'd suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there. The hotel offers a discount at the weekends. 
  There was a problem with the internet access, so I couldn't check my email, but I didn't complain about it to the management. 
  Yes, I was. Here's their business card. 
  No, there wasn't. There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal. 
  I know. At the inland hotel, they have an interesting policy. When you check out, you put some money in a special box at reception. Each evening, the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff.
  Sure. You mean this one? 
  It's a state-of-the-art piece of equipment, sir. With a gigantic 16. 1 USGA TFT screen, 2. 8 Ghz mobile processor, generous 512 MB RAM, removable 80 GB hard drive, convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive, stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM, dual battery capability, integrated Fast Ethernet card, IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports, it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook! 
  The regular price is $ 2980. 00, but until December the 31st it's on sale for just $ 2, 699. 00.
  Sure! I can help you. Do you know where the timesheets are kept? 
  Well, once you get one off the shelf over there, you first put your name on it. OK? 
  Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week. Do you know how to use military time? 
  OK, so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it. Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes. OK? 
  After you total your hours, make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor. 
  Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on.
  Well, we try! Here, I just made some carrot juice. Would you like a glass? 
  You don't have to go to the mountains! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning! 
  Have a good day at school! See you tonight!
  Our meal was absolutely perfect! 
  Dessert sounds perfect, but I would like to split something with my friends. 
  I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful. 
  We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake. Could you bring us four dessert forks, please? 
  We are all tea drinkers. Please bring us four teas. 
  The hot drinks first would be great. Thanks!
  Well, I am a little bit out of shape. I think I should get some exercise to keep fit. what kind of service do you offer? 
  How can you get that done? 
  What else? 
  Sounds pretty good. How much do you charge? 
  Perhaps one month. I'll just have a try at first. 
  OK, I'll take it.
  Of course, this is my first time here. My Mom has a membership here. Here is the card. 
  It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market. 
  Well, I want to become just like Bruce Lee. What should I do? 
  I am still young. And I'm growing every minute. 
  I love running. Anything else? 
  I'm perfect with my clothes. And I do not have anything else with me. 
  Oh, that's the only place where jeans are not popular. I'd better just go home.
  Yes, speaking. 
  Yes. He got up a bit late this morning. He missed the school bus. 
  The clock didn't work this morning. I worked overtime till midnight at home last night, so I got up late,too. It was already nine o'clock when I woke him up. 
  Yes. He didn't go to bed until 11:00 pm. 
  He's a 'night owl'. He can't fall asleep before 11:00 pm. 
  I will. Thank you for calling, Susan.
  I'm not sure. My dad says I should work in information technology. You know something with computers. 
  Not really. He is an engineer. 
  Well. I'm interested in medicine. I'd love to be a doctor. 
  Math is my best subject. And I'm also pretty good at science.
  Good morning. have a reservation for a single room with a bath here. 
  Bradley, John Bradley. 
  OK. Can I borrow your pen for a minute, please? 
  What should I fill in under Room Number? 
  Here you are. I think I've filled in everything correctly. 
  October 24th. 
  OK. I'll take good care of it. 
  Yes, please.
  It certainly is. It was a great report. It indicates that the job market, broadly speaking, has turned the corner after 3 very long, lean years. I think we are going to see improvement. It's not only the March gain. It was gain in January and February. They were both revised higher, and moreover, the job gains were very broadly-based across many industries. It was a very positive report. 
  As I mentioned, when we looked at the numbers, 'we are seeing employment across the board in all sectors, with one important exception, and that's in manufacturing. Well, we do not have any job loss in manufacturing sector for the first time in 44 months. We did not see pick up in the manufacturing sector, but we saw restaurant and hotel workers being added on. We saw workers in supermarket being added on. Part of that reflects the settlement of the grocery stores strike out California. We saw workers in the health care sector and hospitals being added on. We saw business services adding employees. So in general, with the very important exception of manufacturing, we are seeing job growth across all of these different types of occupations.
  No, but I can't stand him anymore. He is the worst roommate I've ever had. He never cleans up after himself and he is always listening to loud music when I try to get some sleep. 
  I've tried, but it didn't work. Maybe you can talk to him. After all, you are his good friend.
  What have you got this morning?  
  I'd like to have a glass of tomato juice, please.  
  Yes, a dish of cream of wheat.  
  Yes, bacon and eggs with buttered toast. I like my bacon very crisp.  
  Fried, please.  
  No, that's enough. T hank you. 
  Let me see. . . I am sorry the tables you want are booked.  
  No problem, sir. Let me help you. 
  What happened? Did your boss say something to offend you at work?  
  Don't you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn't be so bad...  
  That's what you get for working in a male-dominated field. I think you'll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way. You probably won't be able to change him. 
  Yeah? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?  
  So what are you going to do? Take up an art class or something?  
  I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?  
  It's about time!
